Priest: This should never happen to any child<br />02:43<br />The Holy Father rightly acknowledges the staggering toll and the church's culpability. "Looking back to the past,"<br />he wrote<br />, "no effort to beg pardon and to seek to repair the harm done will ever be sufficient. Looking ahead to the future, no effort must be spared to create a culture able to prevent such situations from happening, but also to prevent the possibility of their being covered up and perpetuated."<br />The pontiff called for prayer and penance, fasting by the faithful, and decried a culture of clericalism, which he said "helps to perpetuate many of the evils that we are condemning today. To say 'no' to abuse is to say an emphatic 'no' to all forms of clericalism."<br />The solution, it seems to me, must come from inside the Church but outside the clergy. We lay Catholics are taught from earliest childhood to -- in the words of the old saying-- "Pray, pay and obey." No more.<br />Father James Martin, the Jesuit writer on all things Catholic and a consultant to the Vatican's Secretariat for Communications, communicated this clearly. In a<br />recent op-ed in the New York Times,<br />Martin roused the faithful, exhorting lay Catholics to "Speak to your pastor, write to your bishop, express your anger to the Vatican's nuncio in this country. Most of all, work in any way that you can for real change, even at the cost of being seen as a troublemaker."<br />Reformers from outside the priesthood -- especially women -- must be empowered. After the clergy abuse revelations of the early 2000's, the Catholic Church in America appointed a lay-controlled National Review Board. Its chair, then-Oklahoma Gov. Frank Keating, is a former FBI agent.<br />He described the behavior<br />of the bishops and others in positions of authority -- resisting subpoenas, refusing to reveal the names of rapists, denying the extent of the scandal --  as akin to the conduct of the Mafia.  He resigned from the panel, saying, "My remarks, which some bishops found offensive, were deadly accurate. I make no apology."<br />JUST WATCHED<br /
