Hopkins Architects has won a design competition for a new learning and research centre at the University of Exeter
The practice â€“ working with AECOM â€“ was chosen ahead of bids by WilkinsonEyre, Hawkins\\Brown, John McAslan + Partners and Stride Treglown.
The North Park Project will deliver a new flexible building on the university's Streatham Campus, hosting its institutes of astrophysics, global Sciences, data science and artificial intelligence. It is scheduled to complete in 2022.
The scheme is Hopkins Architects' first in Exeter and the university's largest built environment project in more than a decade.
Hawkins\\Brown completed a new Â£30 million science faculty for the university â€“ known as the Living Systems Building â€“ earlier this year. WilkinsonEyre also completed a landmark new Â£48 million student hub on the campus, known as The Forum , five years ago. Tag
