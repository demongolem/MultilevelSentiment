Home Â» A Mongolian diplomat's path from ANU to Geneva A Mongolian diplomat's path from ANU to Geneva 16 August 2018 Enkhbold is a firm believer that nothing is impossible for those who have the true desire and determination to learn.
I am fully confident that the completion of my master's degree at ANU College of Law was the deciding factor for my successful run in the selection process.
Batzorig Enkhbold is the youngest Deputy Permanent Representative at the Permanent Mission of Mongolia to the United Nations Office and other International Organizations in Geneva and is responsible for coordinating his country's engagement in the UN Human Rights Council.
He secured this position after completing a Master of Laws (LLM) in 2015, which he believes, was the deciding factor for his successful run in the selection process.
Enkhbold said that the completion of his masters was a demanding process but in the end, all the effort was worth it.
"LLM - just three simple letters, however in order to own them one has to go through 'fire'," Batzorig recalls.
"And believe me once you pass that fire, its flames will light the path for you for the rest of your life. I am most grateful for the ANU College of Law for broadening my horizons.
"My research and analytical skills are significantly improved and my passion for international law is now deeper than ever. On a professional note, international security law knowledge that I acquired at the ANU College of Law was instrumental in successfully completing Mongolia's membership in the United Nations Human Rights Council for 2016-2018."
Batzorig was drawn to ANU because of its reputation, stimulating courses, and location.
"ANU is the top academic institution in Australia that offers a world-class post-graduate education in public international law and the courses managed to challenge me intellectually throughout the duration of my studies.
"Personally, I always prefer to live and study in a nice and serene environment. Thus, Canberra embodied the perfect location."
For students interested in studying postgraduate law, Batzorig gave the following encouragement.
"Nothing is impossible in this world for those who have the true desire and determination to learn.
It is not about succeeding or failing, but the effort to reach one's goal that counts."
