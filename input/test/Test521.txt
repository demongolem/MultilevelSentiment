Stomopneustes variolaris is a widespread species of sea urchin in the world that have edible gonads that are in high demand. This study attempted to examine the levels of accumulated toxic trace metals and their relationship between the test diameter and the gonad weight of the black sea urchin ( S. variolaris ) in Sri Lanka. Results As S. variolaris is highly abundant in southwest coast of Sri Lanka, three sampling sites were selected in this region (Mount-Lavinia, Beruwala and Tangalle). The concentration of toxic trace metals (Hg, Cd, Pb and As) in the gonads of S. variolaris was determined in randomly selected subset from the above samples. The levels of above metals in gonads did not exceed the permitted standard levels of the EU and Sri Lanka. The mean size and weight of S. variolaris collected from Mount-Lavinia was 5.55â€‰Â±â€‰1.04 cm and 101.40â€‰Â±â€‰57.76 g, respectively; for Beruwala it was 6.54â€‰Â±â€‰0.86 cm and 147.90â€‰Â±â€‰50.40 g, respectively, and for Tangalle it was 6.41â€‰Â±â€‰1.05 cm and 150.50â€‰Â±â€‰59.45 g respectively. There was a significant relationship between all the analysed trace metals and the test diameter and gonad weight of S. variolaris in Sri Lanka. Conclusions This study revealed that the trace metal levels in gonads of S. variolaris did not exceed the harmful level for human consumption. Background Heavy metals that are less soluble in water tend to accumulate in marine ecosystems as they do not degrade [ 1 ]. Therefore, these toxic trace metals will accumulate along the trophic levels which will affect the entire marine community. The levels of trace metal accumulation in marine organisms depend on their detoxification mechanism in metabolism. The harmfulness of these toxic trace metals is due to their role in biochemical and metabolic processes. Excessive consumption of sea food with high levels of accumulated toxic trace metals can lead to metabolic dysfunctions. Therefore, quantification of toxic trace metals in the all biota is very important to monitor both ecosystem health and public health. Currently, sea urchin gonads are a delicacy in many countries, and thus, there is a very high demand. However, nothing is known about the levels of accumulated toxic trace metals in sea urchins [ 1 , 2 ]. The black sea urchin, Stomopneustes variolaris, is one of the edible species of sea urchin in the world. In Sri Lanka, S. variolaris is restricted to the western and southern coastal areas than other coastal areas [ 3 , 4 ]. The black sea urchin ( S. variolaris ) is one of the warm water sea urchin species that belongs to the family Stomopneustidae. They bore into the rock, reefs and other substrates in littoral regions up to a depth of 18 m, and they prefer to live in the shady areas. S. variolaris is an omnivore species, and also they are known to mainly feed on algae and seaweeds [ 5 â€“ 13 ]. S. variolaris species has a widespread distribution [ 12 , 14 , 15 ], in tropical and subtropical regions of the Indo-Pacific from the east African coast and Madagascar to New Caledonia and Samoa to the Bonin Islands to the north [ 12 ]. It is an abundant edible species in the Indian Ocean, in the geographical regions such as Lakshadweep Islands, Andaman Islands, India and Sri Lanka [ 16 ]. The growth rate of sea urchins and natural mortality mainly depend on temperature and food availability [ 6 ]. The sea urchins accumulate nutrients in the gonad, which is a highly sought-after delicacy in the world [ 17 â€“ 19 ]. The trace metals are accumulated in most body parts of echinoderms including coelomic fluid, spines, gut, gonads and Aristotle's lantern. Hence, levels of trace metals in sea urchins could be used as a bio-indicator to determine the level of environmental pollution [ 20 ]. Currently, nothing is known about the levels of trace metals in the gonads of sea urchins in Sri Lanka, which has high demand in the marine fisheries export industry [ 18 , 19 ]. Therefore, this study was conducted to get an idea on the levels of toxic trace metals in S. variolaris in Sri Lanka. Methods A total of 197 individuals of S. variolaris were collected from three selected sites in the western and southern coasts of Sri Lanka, namely Mount-Lavinia ( n â€‰=â€‰43), Beruwala ( n â€‰=â€‰99) and Tangalle ( n â€‰=â€‰55) reefs (Fig. 1 ) from May to November in 2014. All collected individuals were transported immediately with seawater to analytical chemistry laboratory at the Institute of Post-Harvest Technology (IPHT), National Aquatic Research Agency (NARA) within 24 h. After that, total body weight to nearest 0.01 g and the horizontal test diameter was measured to the nearest 0.02 mm using a vernier caliper. Horizontal test diameter was measured twice perpendicularly to the first measurement and the averages of the two measurements were taken. Finally, gonads were removed from each individuals and weighed after removing excess water using blotting papers. Fig. 1 Sampling sites of S. variolaris To determine the toxic trace metal levels in gonads of S. variolaris , individuals with test/shell diameter between 3 and 9 cm were selected and 6, 13 and 11 individuals were selected from Mount-Lavinia, Beruwala and Tangalle, respectively [ 21 ]. The levels of toxic trace metals, Hg (mercury), Pb (lead), Cd (cadmium) and As (arsenic) were assayed in the atomic absorption spectrophotometer (AAS) (Varian 240 FS, Springvale, Australia). The standard solutions of Hg, Pb, Cd and As at 1000 mg/L (ppm) were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich (Dorset, United Kingdom) which were used to calibrate. All standards and reagents were prepared using ultra-pure water. One gram of homogenized sea urchin gonad samples were taken into a Teflon microwave digestion tube and all the samples were performed in duplicates. Acid digestions of gonad samples were performed by using the 10 mL of HNO 3 (65% nitric acid, AR) allowed to 10â€“15 min and capped the microwave digestion tubes. The sea urchin gonad samples were digested using the CEM/MARS XP-1500â€‰+â€‰microwave oven (CEM, Matthews, USA). Microwave accelerated system and allowed to cool room temperature and pressure was released carefully by opening the valve. Then the digested gonad samples were transferred into 50 mL of volumetric flasks and volumed up using the de-ionized water was used to determine the Hg, Pb, Cd and As of digested sea urchins' gonads samples. A graphite tube atomizer (Varian GTA-120) was used to determine the Pb and Cd, for the determinations of As palladium nitrate (Pd(NO 3 ) 2 ) was used as a modifier. The Hg concentration of sea urchins' gonads were determined by using the cold vapour techniques (Varian VGA 77) using the SnCl 2 as a reduction [ 3 , 4 , 22 ]. The Pearson's correlation coefficient ( r ) and significant correlation tests were conducted to assess the relationship between gonadal trace metals levels and test diameter and gonad weight of S. variolaris . Data were analysed using the Minitab 16.0 version and Microsoft Excel 2010 version at the level of significance at Î± â€‰=â€‰0.05 (5%). Results Toxic trace metals levels in gonads Levels of toxic trace metals in gonads of S. variolaris were determined separately from selected sites and the average values of accumulated concentration (ppm and ppb) and the total amount of trace metals with their average test diameter and gonad weight in selected individuals' are determined. The average concentration (ppb) of Hg in selected individuals from Mount-Lavinia reef ( n â€‰=â€‰11) ranged from (minimum to maximum) 0.00 (Â±â€‰0.00) to 14.40 (Â±â€‰5.33) Î¼g/kg and total concentration in gonads varied from 0.00 to 0.27 Î¼g (Table 1 ). The trace metal Cd ranged from 47.81 (Â±â€‰19.58) to 336.10 (Â±â€‰21.46) Î¼g/kg and total concentration in gonads varied from 0.08 to 6.28 Î¼g. Pb was not detected in the selected individuals from Mount-Lavinia. However, concentration of As ranged from 0.00 (Â±â€‰0.00) to 1805.87 (Â±â€‰104.54) Î¼g/kg, and total accumulation by gonads varied from 0.00 to 33.75 Î¼g.
