In order to run in the election set for later this year, hopefuls need the backing of four local councils, or 20 TDs or Senators. There are currently five people hoping to win this support, independent Marie Goretti Moylan not making a pitch to the council on Thursday.
While one independent councilor voiced support for Duffy, Sharkey's comments sparked some anger, with one member of the local authority stating that he would "never" support a candidate who did not reject Trump.
"When people say put Ireland first, that's just common sense... When I go to Birmingham, Manchester, Luton, I see something I never want to see in Ireland," Sharkey argued.
"I know racism, this [his comments] is not racism," adding that he has known racism throughout his life.

This is not the first time that the artist has spoken out on immigration with the aim of winning a Presidential candidacy. In April, he told the Ray D'Arcy show: "If we don't protect our future, if we don't protect what we have, what has made us Irish, we won't be Irish in 200 years.
"I'm not against immigration. Look at Australia. They have a beautiful system there. If you are contributing, if you have a trade that we need and you can support yourself you are welcome.
"We should have an honest, open dialogue about it without being shut down and called racist.
"I'd hope to bring an awareness to the fact that in Ireland we seem to have shifted away a little bit from looking after the Irish first," he added, stating that we had "fallen into this politically correct speech and people are censoring themselves when they really should be able to have an honest dialogue."

The other speakers at the council were also offered the opportunity to speak for 15 minutes about what their Presidential bid would entail. Senator Freeman spoke about clerical sex abuse, sharing her belief that Pope Francis should meet with victims when he visits Ireland.
"Like you, I am very very anxious the Pope will visit the victims of sexual abuse in this country," she said.
"I would be very disappointed if he didn't, because the Pope has very significant healing powers and we need that as a country."
