MIAMI , Aug. 17, 2018 /PRNewswire-PRWeb/ -- Language On Miami School has won the 2018 Best of Miami Award in the category of Language Schools. Despite frequent news media coverage about the recent and continuing slowdown in temporary visitors, and especially students, to the United States , a relatively small number of English language programs and institutions continue to thrive in an otherwise difficult environment. In fact, according to information published by the Commission on English Language Program Accreditation (CEA) -- a national accrediting agency recognized by the United States Department of Education for the accreditation of postsecondary English language programs and institutions -- more than 20 accredited language programs and institutions have closed their doors since January 2017 alone. During this period of time, however, Language On Schools (an English school with campuses in downtown Miami , Miami Beach and Orlando , Florida ) has grown significantly in terms of both campus locations and the number of enrolled students in their Intensive English Course. In recognition of its continuing success and high levels of student satisfaction, Language On's downtown Miami campus, located on Brickell Avenue, was conferred the 2018 Miami Award by the Miami Award Program. When asked to comment on this accolade, the school's director Scott Rachlin noted that while he was extremely pleased to accept the award on the school's behalf, he was not surprised. "We are of course thrilled, honored and humbled to receive this award in recognition of our ongoing efforts on behalf of the more than 100 students studying in our downtown Miami English School. However, we're not surprised to receive the award because we know, based on our student survey results and especially the many positive public reviews of our school on Google and other sites, that we have very high levels of satisfaction among both current and former students. In fact, student services and ensuring the utmost in providing excellent service to our students is and has always been one of our school's top priorities," Rachlin noted. McDorman, Language On's Chief Academic Officer, went on to point out the relationship among student accomplishments, high levels of student satisfaction and the school's success. McDorman explained that "we are very proud to receive this award, which only serves to reinforce our student-centered approach to language instruction. With more than 95 percent of our students consistently demonstrating high levels of achievement of our English program's student learning outcomes, it comes as no surprise that almost all of our students feel very satisfied with their Language On experience. Research in the field has demonstrated a strong correlation between levels of student engagement and student achievement, so this is an especially critical focal point for our institution's management team." However, when asked how the school would celebrate this award, McDorman insisted that the school would not rest on its laurels: "Our organizational focus right now is not on celebrating, but on continuing to work hard to ensure the continued success of our students.
