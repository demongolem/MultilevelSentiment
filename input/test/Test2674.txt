ALASTAIR LYNCH: WHY QCLASH IS MUST-WIN FOR LIONS
However, it is understood honesty is another Lions value, and past players say the 23-year-old shouldn't be hung for speaking his mind.
Former Lion Alastair Lynch said it had added a new level of interest to the derby and it reminded him of former teammate Jason Akermanis, who routinely earned the ire of his coach for his outspoken nature.
Not surprisingly, Akermanis loved it.
And he reckons there are few tougher players in the competition than Robertson, who will have no trouble backing up his comments. media_camera Nick Robertson has ignited the QClash with his epic Gold Coast sledge.
"I heard Chris (Fagan) say the other week we are in the entertainment business. Well, no one was really talking about the clash til last night, so a bit more banter doesn't hurt,'' he said.
"He'll go out and play hard footy and no one will care. His standard of hardness is right up there.''
Brisbane went into damage control on Friday with Stefan Martin, who was supposed to be fronting a press conference ahead of his 100th game as a Lion, instead distancing the club from Robertson's "soft" sledge.
Martin said the comments had missed the mark after the Lions lost both contested ball and clearances in the season's first QClash won by the Suns.
"No doubt they're going to use it as motivation, but we can't control that any more,'' he said.
"If they come out hard at us, we're just going to go back at them and we'd want to do that anyway.
"We'll meet that challenge head on."
