All the information you need on the launch of Women in Marketing (WiM) Africa through their Loeries Masterclass today, as well as how this serves as an opportunity to showcase what 21st Century Africa looks like to the rest of the world, through the transformative creativity and innovation that comes from the continent, the African stories that can resonate with anyone and the world-class work being done here. Andrea Opoku, founder of WiM Africa and director of the Women in Marketing CIC. Whether you're attending Loeries Creative Week live (yay, Yolo!) or keeping track of the festivities from afar (ah, Fomo for you), one of the stand-out factors of the 40th annual Loeries Awards is that they include the launch of the African chapter of Women in Marketing.
Here Andrea Opoku, director of Women in Marketing global and my fellow advisor and ambassador for Women in Marketing Africa, shares what she's most looking forward to from attending her first Loeries event while also explaining the WiM origin story and what to expect as the Women in Marketing: Africa movement embraces the continentâ€¦
Let's take a step back and start off with the context of launching the original UK version of Women in Marketing, as well as challenges and triumphs you've faced along the way.
The Women in Marketing (WiM) network was created in 2004, under the Chartered Institute of Marketing (CIM). Ade Onilude who was a CIM volunteer at the time wanted to offer something different to the standard 'pale, stale and male' industry events that were being held at the time.
The aim was to offer a platform for women in the marketing and advertising fields, to feel empowered and be educated, inspired and connect with other women in the industry.
It started with an event on Work-Life Balance during International Women's Day (IWD) in March 2004, and this annual event has gone on to tackle topics such as ethical marketing, the creatives, branding and diversity in marketing, with the purpose of provoking discussion and inspiring women in the industry and the wider business community.
#FairnessFirst: Amplifying the female voice The first work week of 2018 for many was also one where we heard the global female voice loud and clear on social media, with 'celebration emojis' for everything from Iceland's equal pay law to #HereWeAre, #TimesUp and #Oprah2020...

WiM has evolved significantly since 2004 â€“ no longer a part of the CIM, in 2016 WiM became a Community Interest Company â€“ and now serves a global network of over 16,000 industry professionals.
The decision to become a stand-alone organisation, independent of the CIM, was a leap of faith. We'd had 12 years of being backed by a very well established membership institution with all the benefits that came with that. But to expand globally, we needed to make the move.
Surprisingly, one of the biggest challenges we've faced since becoming independent is gaining the financial support from the industry in the UK. The vast majority of our funding comes from outside the UK. This has been a real struggle, not just for WiM but also other organisations operating in the gender, diversity and inclusion space. I believe its due to a number of factors, not least the uncertainty around leaving the European Union and the impact it will have on UK businesses. One of the biggest triumphs has been opening the annual WiM Awards to global entries. Over the years we've had so much interest internationally but we were never able to allow entries from outside the UK, until the 2017 awards. Since then, it's been amazing the response we've had, and I'm looking forward to seeing the high calibre of entries we'll get this year.
Yes, you added a soft African element last year, when global entries were allowed into the Women in Marketing award competition â€“ what was the response like?
We had a great response with entries from Singapore, Sweden, the USA, Brazil as well as South Africa. The entries were limited from South Africa, but this year, particularly with the launch of WiM Africa, we're expecting a considerable increase in entries from the continent.

Part of my reason for wanting to set up WiM Africa is that it offers a great opportunity to showcase to the rest of the world what 21st century Africa looks like. We want to show the transformative creativity and innovation that comes from the continent, the African stories that can resonate with anyone and the world-class work being done here.
We do this through the WiM Awards, which recognise the crÃ¨me de la crÃ¨me of brand and agency marketers around the world. I'm really hoping to encourage more submissions from the continent and particularly from women of colour.
Making things a bit more granular, explain your personal involvement with Women in Marketing â€“ what appealed to you and made it such a passion?
I knew Onilude before WiM as we were both part of the CIM London region. She was just one of those people you were drawn to, so when she decided to set up Women in Marketing, I jumped at the chance to be part of it.
It was quite early in my career at the time, and it was great to be part of a growing network of senior female marketers. I found it of great inspiration, professionally and personally.
You could say that I've grown up with WiM and seen the challenges faced by women and how they've overcome them, particularly those who've taken time out to have a family and have tried to step back onto the ladder and make their way upâ€¦ This has fed into how I've faced and overcome certain challenges in my life.
