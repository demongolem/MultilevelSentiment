'Like Williams Martini Racing. Nobody says that, they just say Williams.'<br />Szafnauer confirmed that the new entry, fresh start and loss of points was because the administrators, appointed in July, had sold only the team's physical assets to Stroll rather than the shareholding.<br />'From what I understand, if it was a share sale we wouldn't have been a new entrant. We would have just continued. But because it was an asset sale, and not a share sale, we then had to become a new entrant,' he said.<br />'And once you become a new entrant, the old entrant ceases and we start from zero.'<br />The team turned up at Circuit de Spa-Francorchamps with equipment stripped of sponsors<br />Szafnauer said he understood the administrators' preferred option had been a share sale, which would have ensured the team kept their points, but there had been legal complications with that in the limited time frame available.<br />'That could have been the banks,' he said, referring to claims against the assets of both Mallya and the Sahara Group.<br />A group of Indian banks are seeking to recover more than $1 billion of loans granted to Mallya's defunct Kingfisher Airlines.<br />Force India were sixth in the championship prior to Belgium, with 59 points.<br />Williams were previously last in the standings with only four points from 12 races and Szafnauer was confident his Mercedes-powered team would soon haul themselves off the bottom despite starting with a clean slate at Spa.<br />'I'm pretty confident (that Force India will not be last). We still have a good car, the same drivers, a good team, I'm confident we can score some points,' he said.<br />RELATED ARTICLES<br /
