"Alnylam and the FDA announced Friday the approval of Onpattro for the treatment of polyneuropathy caused by hATTR. Mgmt guided for drug to be available today. WAC price is $450,000/yr and mgmt estimates average net price $345,000/yr. Because the label is focused on polyneuropathy, we assume penetration of the PN (only polyneuropathy symptoms) and Mixed (both cardiomyopathy and polyneuropathy symptoms) subsets, but not the cardiomyopathy subset of the hATTR patient population. Nevertheless, given the impressive efficacy seen in the Phase 3 APOLLO trial, we expect the drug to be an attractive and competitive option for PN +Mixed patients. Reiterate BUY. Our enthusiasm for the stock is still primarily driven by the RNAi platform, which we expect to produce several more differentiated drugs going forward."," Needham & Company LLC's analyst wrote.
