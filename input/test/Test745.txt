Dengue Virus Diagnostic Tests Market to Record Ascending Growth by 2026
Albany, Dengue is a mosquito-borne viral infectious disease affecting humans as well as animals, It is caused by the dengue virus, which belongs to the flaviviridae family and genus flavivirus. Dengue is normally transmitted from one person to another through the bite of an infected aedes aegypti mosquito. Symptoms of this disease include high fever, fatigue, headache, diarrhea, muscle pain, skin rashes, anemia, and vomiting. Severe dengue can cause seizures, yellow skin, coma, or death. Dengue causes CNS manifestations, which include abnormal neurological signs, degree of impaired consciousness, focal and generalized convulsions, and delirium. Causes of neurological manifestations in dengue are due to high-grade fever. A number of tests are available in the market to confirm the diagnosis, including detecting antibodies to the virus or its RNA. Management of dengue is a challenge that is needed to be addressed. There are different causes underlying the clinical event of dengue for which multimodal and effective treatment approach is required. The global Dengue Virus Diagnostic Tests Market is expected to expand substantially due to increase in the incidence of dengue fever. According to the WHO (World Health organization), the number of people suffering from dengue increased from 2.2 million in 2010 to 3.2 million in 2015. The actual number remains underreported. According to data published by Bhatt et al., there are around 390 million dengue patients worldwide each year, and this number is continuously increasing.. 2.35 million dengue patients were found in the Americas region alone, of which 10,200 patients were detected as severe dengue that resulted in 1,181 deaths in 2015. Dengue is a viral disease affecting people across Europe, South America, and Asia. A large number of dengue cases were reported worldwide in 2015, with over 111,000 suspected cases of dengue in Malaysia and over 169,000 cases in the Philippines. This was a staggering 16% and 59.5% increase, respectively, in the number of cases compared to that in 2014. However, low awareness in emerging nations and high under diagnosis rates restrain the market at present. Rising awareness about symptoms for dengue fever and increasing government initiatives to provide better health care facilities are expected to provide ample opportunities for the market.
