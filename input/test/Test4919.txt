You know it's about standing out from the crowd and exploring new ideas. So, why are you holding back? Why is the stuff you're churning out still similar to everyone else's? The 'professional' box From marketers, to business owners, to those trying to build a brand, we all come up with new, creative ideas. We try to market ourselves in different ways and we're always trying to come up with effective ways to catch people's attention. Yet, when it gets round to implementing our ideas, we make sure it's contained within a 'professional' box. It's different, but it's not too different. We'll think of the idea, build it up to dizzying heights, then take out the most innovative parts and try to bring it down a peg or two so that we still maintain a professional image. Butâ€¦the websites, the emails, the tweets, the ideas by others that attract our attention very rarely come from in this box. The stuff that makes us lean forward in our chairs and pay attention haven't even attempted to stay in this box. We know this. Yet we're still scared to venture out of our box in case it'll drive people away. We're too scared to post a tweet with a swear word, an actually interesting description of ourselves on our 'about' page, a profile picture on LinkedIn that isn't against a white backdrop looking like it was taken on school picture dayâ€¦ I'm saying "we" because I'm guilty of this too. At the moment, I'm in the middle of designing and building my new website (with the help of a dev, of course), and our current buzzword is "ridiculous". "Is this too ridiculous?" "Shall I write this or is that too ridiculous?" "How ridiculous would it be if I put this animation here?" And what we're essentially saying is "has anyone done this before? If not, it's probably too risky". Which isn't the right way to design a website. I've recently learnt to never throw ideas away just for being a bit nuts. We shelve them and come back to them later if we're unsure. Ridiculous can be good and we need to learn to embrace it. Although we may need to sleep on an idea before it grows on us, we need to learn not not to control it as much, to stop worrying that we'll scare people off. That ridiculousness will be the bit that grabs people's attention. The takeaway You won't scare people off. You won't be laughed at. Not if you use your common sense and you make the most of your bright ideas. Put you and your ridiculous ideas out there in a big way and don't worry if you're being unprofessional. The people who have grabbed your attention didn't worry about it and it worked for them.
