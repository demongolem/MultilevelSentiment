AP Images - David Banks<br />CHICAGO (AP) â€”<br />Cole Hamels tossed a complete game to continue his dramatic turnaround with the NL Central-leading Chicago Cubs, who got home runs from Anthony Rizzo and Javier Baez in a 7-1 victory over the Cincinnati Reds on Thursday night.<br />Hamels (4-0) allowed eight hits, struck out seven and walked two in his 17th career complete game and the first by a Cubs pitcher this season. His ERA in five starts with Chicago is 0.72.<br />Before being traded to the Cubs, the veteran left-hander was 5-9 with a 4.72 ERA in 20 starts for the Texas Rangers.<br />Rizzo went 2 for 2 with a walk and three RBIs.<br />Baez was 3 for 5, reached on an error and scored three runs. The homer, his 27th, was a mammoth 481-foot solo shot that cleared the bleachers just left of straightaway center and landed on Waveland Avenue.<br />He also turned in a stellar defensive play at shortstop, backpedaling and diving onto the outfield grass to snag a soft liner by Dilson Herrera to end the seventh.<br />Hamels had allowed just two earned runs in his first four starts with Chicago, but the Reds jumped out to a 1-0 lead in the first as Phillip Ervin beat out an infield single with two outs, scoring Billy Hamilton from third base.<br />The Cubs quickly answered. After Baez reached on an error with one out, Rizzo hit the first pitch he saw from starter Anthony DeSclafani (6-4) into the bleachers in right for a 2-1 Chicago lead. Baez&#8217;s homer in the third made it 3-1.<br />In the fifth, Baez doubled with one out, advanced to third on a wild pitch and scored on Rizzo&#8217;s sacrifice fly to stretch the margin to 4-1.<br />The Cubs then broke it open with three runs in the seventh.<br />Cincinnati loaded the bases with one out in the ninth, but Hamels got Tucker Barnhart to ground into a game-ending double play on his 114th pitch.<br />ROSTER MOVES<br />The Cubs placed RHP Tyler Chatwood on the 10-day DL with left hip inflammation. The move is retroactive to Tuesday. RHP Dillon Maples was recalled from Triple-A Iowa.<br />Chatwood, 28, has struggled with his control after signing with the Cubs as a free agent in the offseason. He is 4-6 with a 5.22 ERA in 23 games (20 starts) with 93 walks in 101 2/3 innings.<br />TRAINER&#8217;S ROOM<br />Reds: RF Scott Schebler (sprained right shoulder) continued his rehab assignment with Double-A Pensacola. Cincinnati manager Jim Riggleman said Schebler will travel to Chicago on Friday and be activated on Saturday.<br />Cubs: RHP Yu Darvish (stress reaction right elbow) is out for the season but said he is relieved doctors finally discovered the source of his elbow pain. &#8220;At first, I was told it was a simple tightness, but I always knew there was something else other than the tightness,&#8221; he said through a translator. . 3B Kris Bryant (left shoulder inflammation) is expected to increase the intensity of his swings during a batting practice session Friday.<br />UP NEXT<br />The Cubs will recall RHP Alec Mills from Triple-A Iowa to start the second game of the series Friday. Mills has pitched two scoreless innings of relief for Chicago this season. The 26-year-old is 5-12 with a 4.84 ERA in 23 starts at Iowa. RHP Matt Harvey (6-7, 4.91 ERA) goes for the Reds after taking a no-hitter into the sixth inning during his last start.<br /
