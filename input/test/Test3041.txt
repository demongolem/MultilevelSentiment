Lee Johnson admits he couldn't stand in Aden Flint's way when Middlesbrough made an approach.
The strapping defender moved from Bristol City to Boro in June and he hasn't had to wait long for a return visit to the West County.
Bristol boss Johnson remains on good terms with his former player and admitted he still keeps in touch with him.
"I've spoken to him on the phone," he said.
"Initially, once the deal was done there was a lot of red tape to go through so you let that settle, you want the player to settle with his family and the situation with the hotel. Then we contacted each other and wished each other all the best.
"I'll always be there for any of my ex-players. If they need football advice, relationship advice, career advice, I'll help them. Read More Bernie Slaven: Wing off to a flyer, surprise frontline return for Braithwaite & Assombalonga
"As long as they have done everything they can to train and improve every day and Aden, without question, was one of those.
"Like I say, I didn't want to see him leave but it turned out that he did and given that fact, of course we wish him all the best." Aden Flint celebrates against Sheffield United
Johnson knows all about Flint's scoring threat and will have a plan in place to stop the defender from grabbing a goal at the weekend.
"He's a threat in the box, there's no denying that, it's important that we do our job and do it very well," he said.
City were keen to keep Flint and the defender signed a new contract earlier this year in a bid to warn off prospective buyers. Read More Bristol City braced for Boro's 'big lurch' Aden Flint and a tough test against Tony Pulis
Johnson revealed that the intention was reward the player if City had won promotion last season.
"It's aways difficult to tell the whole truth and nothing but the truth, you have to be careful," he said at his pre-match press conference.
"I can only liken it to you, if you were offered the chance to triple your wage, to move across town to another website, naturally, at your age, you would have to think about it. Bristol City's Lee Johnson
"Football is a short career. It's very difficult to stand in a player's way.
"We gave Aden a new contract with the big carrot that if we get into the Premier League we would blow other Championship teams out of the water with our wage because of, obviously, the Premier League money.

"That settled down, he knew that if we got in the Premier League he would be handsomely rewarded and that showed in his contract.
"But there was no gentleman's agreement, or handshake or contract clause or anything like that. It became a case of it becoming almost immoral to stand in his way." Like us on Faceboo
