FAMILY FESTIVALS: Y-Not Festival Credit: Carolina Farulo (left and right); Max Miechoski (centre) 2018 is the year of the family festival and Y-Not really was up there with our family-friendly expectations. The Peak District affair delivered on line up with The Libertines, Manic Street Preachers and Jamiroquai (their best line up yet!), but Y-Not still has that small and friendly festival feel. With dedicated family camping, early morning activities for the little ones, as well as magic shows and the kids' Yellow Submarine Main Stage, it's a really happy family festival. What's more â€“ under 12s go free. We're hoping to see you there next year
