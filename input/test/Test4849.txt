Hyderabad: A 23-year-old law student from Bengaluru was found hanging at a lodge in Begum Bazaar on Thursday morning.
According to the Begum Bazaar police, Chiranjeevi, an LLB second year student from a law college in Bengaluru, had turned his mobile phone switched off since Monday. He took a room in My Choice lodge on Tuesday for two days and at night bought liquor and food. He consumed the liquor, but did not have food. "After having liquor, he is suspected to have committed suicide by hanging himself from the ceiling. No suicide note was found," the police said.
The incident came to light on Thursday, when the staff in the lodge sensed a foul smell emanating from his room. When they knocked on the door, there was no response from inside. When they broke it open, they found his body in a decomposed state on the bed.
A case was booked and being probed. Police said no reason was found yet. His family in Bengaluru was informed and the body shifted to Osmania General Hospital
