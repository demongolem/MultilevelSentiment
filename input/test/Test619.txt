In an early morning operation, the CBI on Friday started searches at five premises of former Bihar Minister Manju Verma in connection with the Muzzafarpur shelter home abuse case, officials said.
In addition to five locations, search operations were also underway at the time of writing this report at seven premises of Brajesh Thakur, who ran the NGO, his friends and relatives, they said.
The searches were spread across three residences of former Social Welfare Minister Verma in Patna and one each in Motihari and Bhagalpur, they said.
Verma had resigned last week following allegations that her husband was a regular visitor to the girls' shelter home where minor girls were facing sexual abuse.
It was alleged by the wife of an arrested accused from the department that Verma's husband was a frequent visitor to the Muzaffarpur shelter home, where 34 girls were allegedly raped over a period of time.
What appears to have precipitated her resignation was media reports that examination of mobile phone details of key accused Brajesh Thakur showed that he had spoken to her husband 17 times from January to June this year.
