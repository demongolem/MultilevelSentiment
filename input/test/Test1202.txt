Â» Diagnosed With Prediabetes, Should You Be Worried? Diagnosed With Prediabetes, Should You Be Worried? Diabetes By Bindu Vinodh on August 16, 2018
Prediabetes is a condition characterized by elevated or higher than normal blood glucose levels, but not high enough to be diagnosed with diabetes. It is often an indication that a person is at risk of progressing to Type 2 diabetes.
If you have prediabetes and do not make lifestyle modifications, you may develop Type 2 diabetes within 10 years. Therefore, if you have been diagnosed with prediabetes, the first thing you should do is to consult a doctor and incorporate the suggested diet and lifestyle modification. Diagnosis Of Prediabetes
One of the tests suggested is the HbA1c test that measures your average blood sugar levels at a three-month average. This can be done at random, without fasting. The value of HbA1c may fall in the range 5.7 and 6.4 per cent if you are prediabetic. The higher your A1c result, the greater your risk for type 2 diabetes.
You may also be advised to do a fasting blood sugar test, and for this, you have to fast for eight hours or overnight. A blood sugar level of 100 to 125 mg per decilitre indicates this condition. Types Of Diabetes
The most common types of diabetes are Type 1 diabetes and Type 2 diabetes.
In the case of Type 1 diabetes, there is little or no insulin in the body, as your immune system attacks and kills the beta cells in the pancreas. Therefore, sugar is not utilised for energy and there is a build-up of blood sugar. This type of diabetes mostly develops in childhood or in adulthood.
The Type 2 diabetes occurs when the body is unable to utilize the insulin released, or does not make enough insulin. Hence, there is sugar build-up in the blood, instead of being used as energy. At least 90 per cent of people diagnosed with diabetes fall into this category. Type 2 diabetes often occurs in adults. Difference Between Prediabetes And Type 2 Diabetes
â€¢ Prediabetes is often a warning sign for type 2 diabetes, and an indication that you should take care of your health more seriously.
â€¢ Type 2 diabetes is a condition that occurs slowly with time.
â€¢ While prediabetes can be reversed through lifestyle and diet, Type 2 diabetes cannot be cured completely and requires medications, apart from lifestyle changes to avoid complications. Factors Triggering Prediabetes
While prediabetes can occur to just anyone, some major risk factors that trigger prediabetes are as follows:
â€¢ If you are over 45 years of age, and have a Body Mass Index (BMI) higher than 25, you may have to get yourself screened for prediabetes.
â€¢ Carrying excess fat around your waist (over 35 inches for females, 40 inches or more for males)
â€¢ Sedentary lifestyl
