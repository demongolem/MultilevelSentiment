A panel for the US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit [judicial website] on Tuesday vacated [opinion, PDF] a lower court's decision dismissing a suit against the Department of Homeland Security [official website] for confiscating photos of law enforcement officials at the border.
The photos were taken by activist Christian Ramirez in 2010 on a pedestrian bridge near the US-Mexican border. Ramirez observed a Customs and Border Protection official patting down only women who were crossing the border and became concerned. He took "approximately ten photos" on his cellphone. Several officers surrounded Ramirez, took his phone, and deleted the photographs.
The opinion stated, "the First Amendment protected the right to photograph and record matters of public interest, and whether a place was 'public' depended on the nature of the location." The burden of proving that confiscating the photographs were the "least restrictive means" rests with the government.
The lower court had ruled that deleting the photos was "that least restrictive means of serving the compelling interest of protecting the United States's territorial sovereignty" while applying strict scrutiny.
