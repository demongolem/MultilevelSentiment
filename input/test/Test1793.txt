It is an absolute playground for animation,&quot;<br />says<br />Alexander Bulkley<br />, CEO &amp; Founder of ShadowMachine.<br />&quot;We couldn't be more stoked to have this level of creativity and craftsmanship on board our space adventure. Roberto's incredible sense of story and science fiction mastery and<br />ShadowMachine's<br />excellent animation and design chops have already elevated the project to the next level. I think we are sitting on an amazing origin story for<br />Galaga<br />that will not disappoint fans of the game, or of science fiction in general,&quot;<br />says<br />Magnus Jansson<br />, CEO of The Nuttery.<br />The Nuttery first announced the project at last year's San Diego Comic Con, a unique animated brand extension of BANDAI NAMCO's 36-year-old arcade gaming classic. The animated re-imagining of the iconic game is planned for a 12-episode inaugural season.<br />&quot;In the initial development, we have focused on creating a solid foundation of the meta universe - building out an intricate and vast tapestry of intergalactic politics, strife, and endless new possibilities. The first series is a small part in the grand scheme and will be a story of hope, sacrifice, and family - all wrapped up in what is shaping up to be an incredible sci-fi adventure with some really awesome characters. This first series will lay the groundwork for the entire meta universe and many more installments to come,&quot;<br />says<br /
