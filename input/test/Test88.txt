Kieran Read might be focussed on ensuring the Wallabies don't win back the Bledisloe Cup, but he found time to read Josh Thomson a bedtime story.

All Black skipper Kieran Read launches podcast for children Thankfully, skipper Read, 32 has every parent covered with a new series of bedtime podcasts for children - Bedtime Stories, which will be released on Saturday just in time for the first Bledisloe Cup test.
So, The Project's resident big kid Josh Thomson caught up with Read for a listen.
Read says he wasn't nervous at all when making the podcast saying it was done all in one take.
