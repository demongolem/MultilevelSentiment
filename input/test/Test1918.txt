Another Edsa experiment set this Monday. â€”EDWIN BACASMAS
Senator Aquilino Pimentel III wants senior citizens to be exempted from the new traffic ban on Edsa.
"Let's exempt senior citizen from this rule," Pimentel said in a statement on Thursday.
"Exemption from this traffic scheme means they would be able to reach their destinations easier and faster. We should do everything we could to give utmost consideration to the elderly," he added.
The Senate adopted on Wednesday a resolution urging the to suspend the ban on driver-only vehicles on Edsa during rush hours.
The approval of the measure came on the same day the MMDA started its weeklong dry run of the ban.

Pimentel noted that only 8.2% of the population are senior citizens, and that the percentage of senior citizen drivers using Edsa is probably even lower.
"This will not be a big dent on the target reduction of 70% of vehicular traffic during rush hours," he said.
"The MMDA should consider seniors as belonging to special class of citizens entitled to exemption. Commuting in Metro Manila is admittedly very difficult; more so for senior citizens who may not be able to handle the physical stress that comes with taking public transport."
"We should do what we can not to add to the physical and mental stresses of our senior citizens, especially those their age who still have the capacity to drive," he added.
While the ban on solo riders could be"practical short-term solution" to Metro Manila's traffic woes, Pimentel said the envisioned decongestion of Edsa is still dependent on the implementation of a "more modern, efficient and comprehensive public transport system." /ee
