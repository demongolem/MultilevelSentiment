Ideal Response joins charity appeal Share this page 17 Aug 2018 by Neil Nixon Recent news
A team from Maidstone-based disaster recovery specialist, Ideal Response, is donning its running shoes for a sponsored 10k run on behalf of mental health charity, Mind.
Returning in October for another year, the fun run aims to not only help raise awareness of Maidstone and Mid-Kent Mind, but also of mental health in general. Limited to just 100 participants, Ideal Response is pleased to have secured 10 places - with abilities ranging from seasoned marathon runners right through to complete beginners.
Ideal Response staff have started training to complete two laps around Maidstone's Mote Park, and with training well underway, attention has started to shift towards fundraising.
"We know that we can return homes affected by fires and floods back to normal, to make it look as though nothing ever happened," said managing director of Ideal Response, Javid Ibrahim. "But we also know the repair and healing doesn't stop there. If we can in some way help towards the psychological recovery of our customers - who are local people - by supporting local charities to provide the help required, we're all for it. I'm signed up for the run and can't wait to be a part of it."
Thomas Fishenden, marketing apprentice at MMK Mind, said: "As a local organisation, the support we receive from Kent-based businesses like Ideal Response is vital in building a stronger community network. Not only do we connect with new companies who may wish to fundraise for us - boosting the funds we are able to inject back into the community - but we also strengthen our communications network as a whole which enables us to share mental health support with more people. The more companies who get involved, the further we are able to spread our message - showing anyone with a mental health problem that there is support and guidance out there. Having companies like Ideal Response join the events we run, such as our fun run, is also important in bringing the community together with smaller companies - creating positive community cohesion. Mental health is everybody's business so it is important that businesses, members of the public, members of the government and more all pull together to encourage a positive change. We are thankful for Ideal Response, and the other local organisations who work with us tirelessly, day in, day out, to make a positive difference to the community."
