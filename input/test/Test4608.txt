"The idea was put to me to come to Celtic and work with [manager] Brendan Rodgers, and it was something I was very interested in doing, and when it became a reality, I was very excited," Arzani told the club's official website.
"I've had a couple of chats with the manager, more about when I'm coming and when I'll get started, but I'll have more chats with him after I settle into the club. But, for me, it's about coming here, doing the best that I can and helping the club as much as possible."

Tom Rogic, his international team-mate, also had a hand in convincing him to join the Hoops.
"I gave Tom a call and had a chat with him about the club and everything was positive," Arzani added.
"Basically he said to me that if it wasn't so good, he wouldn't have signed an extension to stay at Celtic Park. Apparently, playing in front of the Celtic fans is absolutely amazing and I'm really excited about that.
"All of Celtic's home games look absolutely amazing. The scenes at the game are unbelievable, and I love it when the crowd gets behind me. I'm an attacking player. I love to take players on and hopefully I can bring some of that to the team."
Arzani joined Melbourne City in 2016 and at the end of the 2017/18 A-League season was named the league's Young Footballer of the Year award. He also picked up the Harry Kewell medal for the best U23 player in Australia.
