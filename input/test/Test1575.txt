MANAGEMENT CHANGE AND CORPORATE RESTRUCTURING
Overview
Over the past year, the Company has focused on growing our consulting business while re-evaluating the future state of our technology-related product and service offerings. As part of this re-evaluation, and after several months of review and deliberations, the Company's Board of Directors (the " Board ") determined that it was in the best interests of the Company to separate the Company's growing consulting business from the rest of the Company in order to allow the Company to pursue strategic options such as the development or acquisition of additional product and service offerings, while allowing the management of our consulting business to focus exclusively on growing such business, independent of the Company's software business.
Consequently, on August 16, 2018 , the Board approved the transfer of the assets and liabilities related to the Company's consulting business (excluding the underlying technology and databases related thereto, which remained with the Company) to its wholly-owned subsidiary, McorpCX, LLC.
In connection with this corporate reorganization, Mr. Hinshaw has resigned as the Company's President and Chief Executive Officer in order to devote his full-time energies to the Company's consulting business as President of McorpCX, LLC. However, Mr. Hinshaw will remain as Chairman of the Board, which the Board believes will allow him to continue to provide CX thought leadership for the entire Company.
The Board has appointed the Company's current Chief Financial Officer, Mr. Gregg Budoi to serve as the Company's interim President and Chief Executive Officer.
In connection with his greater role in directing the Company's business, Mr. Budoi has also been appointed to serve as a director on the Board until the next annual meeting of the Company's shareholders.
Mr. Budoi has been the Chief Financial Officer of the Company since September 26, 2017 , and prior to assuming that role with the Company, he had developed extensive experience as an executive leader with both public and private companies including leadership in the SaaS software space. Over the course of his career, Mr. Budoi has had exposure to several disciplines of business management with an emphasis on corporate strategy and finance, capital markets, business development and M&A activities.
"We believe that Gregg brings to the Company as CEO the right mix of skills and experience needed to navigate the Company through this transition period and that the transfer of the Company's consulting operations to McorpCX, LLC will allow the Company to focus on the pursuit of additional product and service offerings, as well as additional strategic options for driving increased shareholder value," stated Matthew Kruchko , independent director on the Board.
As interim President and Chief Executive Officer, Mr. Budoi is expected to focus on developing various potential strategies to improve the Company's ability to achieve additional revenue and profit growth. These possible strategies may include further software or technology development expenditures, pursuit of merger, acquisitions or joint ventures with companies that provide complimentary products and services, software licensing arrangements, and investment in additional infrastructure within our Company. Each of these possible strategies will be thoroughly vetted by the Board to assess expected levels of enterprise value creation compared to various risks associated with each possible scenario.
In connection with Mr. Budoi's appointment as the Company's interim President and Chief Executive Officer, the Board has initiated a search for a new Chief Financial Officer.
Employment Agreements
In connection with his appointment as the Company's interim President and Chief Executive Officer, the Company and Mr. Budoi have entered into an executive employment agreement under which Mr. Budoi will be eligible to receive (in addition to his base salary) a $100,000 bonus contingent upon the achievement of certain milestone events, that include completion of an equity financing in excess of US$5.0 million or completion of an acquisition of a new business with annualized revenues in excess of US$5.0 million per year, among other initiatives. In addition, Mr. Budoi will be entitled to participate in the Company's employee benefit plans and receive stock options under the Company's stock option plan. To reflect his interim role, Mr. Budoi's employment is for an initial term expiring October 31, 2018 , with automatic renewals (subject to right of the Company and Mr. Budoi to elect not to renew) for additional one month periods.
In connection with his appointment as President of McorpCX, LLC, Mr. Hinshaw has entered into an executive employment agreement with McorpCX, LLC under which he will be paid a reduced base salary. He is also eligible to receive additional, incentive-based variable compensation including:
Quarterly payments equal to (i) 2.5% of all gross revenues generated by McorpCX, LLC, plus (ii) an additional 2.5% (for a total of 5%) of all gross revenues generated by McorpCX, LLC in excess of US$5.0 million per year, and Participation in McorpCX, LLC's sales commission plan wherein Mr. Hinshaw can receive sales commissions up to 10% of the aggregate of all fees received by McorpCX, LLC on projects from new clients and new projects with existing clients, which he sells and closes.
Mr. Hinshaw is also eligible to participate in any deferred compensation plan that may be developed in the future by McorpCX, LLC. The term of Mr. Hinshaw's employment with McorpCX, LLC is for an initial six month term, with automatic renewals (subject to the right of McorpCX, LLC and Mr. Hinshaw to elect not to renew) for additional three month periods.
Grant of Stock Options
The Board has also approved the granting of stock options to purchase 700,000 common shares of the Company to Mr. Budoi (300,000 options), and to each of the Board's independent directors, Mr. Nii Quaye , and Mr. Matthew Kruchko (200,000 options each). These options are the first options granted by the Company to Mr. Budoi, Mr. Quaye and Mr. Kruchko. The options will be priced based on the closing price of the Company's common shares on grant date, which is the date of this news release. The options will vest over a three-year period, with 1/3 vesting on the one-year anniversary of the grant date and an additional 1/3 on each of the second and third anniversaries of the grant date. The vesting of these stock options will accelerate upon a change of control.

Note 1
We define EBITDA as net loss plus interest, tax, depreciation and amortization expenses. We consider EBITDA to be a meaningful supplement to net income (loss) as a performance measure primarily because depreciation and amortization expenses are not an actual cash costs, and interest and tax expenses are not related to our direct operating activities. In addition, we believe EBITDA is commonly used by investors and other interested parties to evaluate our financial performance. EBITDA does not reflect the impact of a number of items that affect our net income (loss), including financing costs. EBITDA should not be considered as an alternative to net income (loss) or income (loss) from operations as a measure of performance, or as an alternative to net cash from operating activities as a measure of liquidity. EBITDA is an internal measure and therefore may not be comparable to other companies. EBITDA has significant limitations as an analytical tool, and should not be considered in isolation, or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under GAAP. Some of these limitations are that EBITDA does not reflect: (i) our cash expenditures, or future requirements, for capital expenditures or contractual commitments; (ii) changes in, or cash requirements for, working capital needs; and (iii) the interest expense, or the cash requirements necessary to service interest or principal payments, on our outstanding debt (if any). Because of these limitations, EBITDA should only be considered as a supplemental performance measure and should not be considered as a measure of liquidity or cash available to us to invest in the growth of our business. Because all companies do not calculate EBITDA in the same manner, EBITDA as calculated by us may differ from EBITDA as calculated by other companies. We compensate for these limitations by using EBITDA as a supplemental measure of our performance and by relying primarily on our GAAP financial statements.
The following table provides a reconciliation of net income (loss) to EBITDA for the periods indicated:
