Manchester United striker Romelu Lukaku is considering retiring from international football after the next European Championship.
Lukaku, 25, helped Belgium finish third at the World Cup in Russia this summer but has said he might not make it to Qatar in 2022 and plans to quit after Euro 2020.

Lukaku, who is line to make his first United start of the season against Brighton on Sunday, is Belgium's record goalscorer with 40 goals in 75 games after beginning his international career in 2010.
He is already targeting a first trophy with his national team at the next Euros but suggested after the tournament it may be time to step aside to make room for some of Belgium's talented youngsters -- even if he will only be 27.
"I'm 25, I'm like, I'm not even in my prime yet," he said. I still see them [Belgium's young players] as competition right now because they try to take my spot and I don't want to give it up to them. So like another two years, and then they can have it.
"Every big tournament for us as a country has to be getting into the semifinals, and then you go from there. You will go to win the whole thing, but you don't go for less than the semifinals."
