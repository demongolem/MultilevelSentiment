Consumer Complaint: Sometime in XX/XX/2018, I started receiving phone calls from USI Solutions , Inc regarding a credit card from XXXX XXXX XXXX that was in collections ( and also had a judgment against me ). In wanting to clean up my credit, I agreed to make a payment of {$2400.00} to settle the account. I received a letter stating the settlement agreement on XX/XX/2018. I made the payment. on XX/XX/2018 I received a letter stating the account was paid in full.
in the process of applying for a loan, I was told the judgement was still on my record and was owned/initiated by another company. I contacted that company and was told the account was never settled and they didn't know who USI Solutions is.
on XX/XX/2018 I contacted USI Solutions, Inc and spoke to a XXXX XXXX, who was very rude to me. He first told me he didn't know what company they had purchased my account from, so then I ask for a verification of debt letter, for which he told me the account was closed, and then told me it would take 30 â€“ 90 days to get a verification letter, and then told me I would have to speak to the woman who handled my account but she wasn't there that day.
So now, not only do I still owe over {$4000.00} for the judgement account, I can not get information on from USI Solutions as to how they have the account and to get my money back.
Company: USI Solutions Inc.
