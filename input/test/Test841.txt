India Red face India Green in Duleep Trophy domestic season opener 13:31 File Image (Twitter) Dindigul (Tamil Nadu): Defending champions India Red will take on India Green in the opener of the 57th Duleep Trophy at the NPR College ground here on Friday, marking the start of the 2018-19 domestic cricket season in the country. India Blue side is the third team in the competition that will be played under lights with the pink ball. The tournament will see three round-robin four-day matches followed by the final, that will be played from September 4 over five days. The India Red side will be led by local boy and discarded Test opener Abhinav Mukund, who will be looking to make the most of the chances, and present his case to the BCCI selectors, given the poor form of the India openers in the ongoing England tour. His opposite number in the India Green side, Parthiv Patel will also be aiming to make his way back to the Test side, considering the absence of regular Test keeper Wriddhiman Saha due to injury and the dismal performance of Dinesh Karthik in the opening two Tests of the five-match rubber against England. Besides the two captains, the selectors will also keep a close watch on the young guns on either side.
