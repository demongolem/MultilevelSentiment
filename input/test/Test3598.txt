Google is facing an employee rebellion over fears it is planning to help China build its super-censored internet.
More than one thousand Google employees have signed a letter protesting against a secretive alleged plan to build a search engine that would comply with Chinese censorship by blocking some websites and search terms.
The letter calls on executives to review ethics and transparency at the company. It says employees lack the information required 'to make ethically informed decisions about our work' and complains that most employees only found out about the project after reading about in the press. Staff worried the tech giant is planning to clamp down on freedom of speech and compromise its 'don't be evil' pledge
In June, Google decided against renewing a US military contract called Project Maven after staff penned a separate letter.
At a Google meeting on Thursday, Google chief executive Sundar Pichai told employees the firm was not close to launching a search engine app in China. Advertisement Advertisement
Whether the company could or would launch search in China 'is all very unclear' Pichai said, according to Reuters.
'The team has been in an exploration stage for quite a while now, and I think they are exploring many options,' he added.
Disclosure of the secretive effort, which is codenamed Dragonfly, has disturbed some Google employees and human rights advocacy organizations. They are concerned that by agreeing to censorship demands, Google would validate China's prohibitions on free expression and violate the 'don't be evil' clause in the company's code of conduct.
Hundreds of employees have called on the company to provide more 'transparency, oversight and accountability,' according to an internal petition seen by Reuters on Thursday.

The China petition says employees are concerned Google's ethics principles 'are not enough'.
'We urgently need more transparency, a seat at the table and a commitment to clear and open processes: Google employees need to know what we're building,' states the document seen by Reuters.
The New York Times first reported the petition on Thursday. Google declined to comment.
Company executives have not commented publicly on Dragonfly, and their remarks at the company-wide meeting marked their first about the project since details about it were leaked.
Employees have asked Google to create an ethics review group with rank-and-file workers, appoint ombudspeople to provide independent review and internally publish assessments of projects that raise substantial ethical questions. Advertisement Advertisement
Pichai reportedly told employees: 'We'll definitely be transparent as we get closer to actually having a plan of record here." on Dragonfly, according to the transcript. He noted the company guards information on some projects where sharing too early can 'cause issues'
