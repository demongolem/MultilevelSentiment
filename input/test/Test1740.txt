THURSDAY, Aug. 23, 2018 -- For middle-aged individuals with multimorbidity, frailty is significantly associated with mortality, according to a study published in the July issue of<br />The Lancet Public Health<br />.<br />Peter Hanlon, from the University of Glasgow in the United Kingdom, and colleagues used data from the U.K. Biobank to examine the correlation between frailty, multimorbidity, specific long-term conditions, and mortality in a middle-aged and older aged population. A total of 493,737 participants aged 37 to 73 years were included in the study.<br />The researchers found that 3 percent of participants were considered frail, 38 percent pre-frail, and 59 percent not frail. There was a significant correlation for frailty with multimorbidity (prevalence, 18 percent in those with four or more long-term conditions: odds ratio, 27.1), socioeconomic deprivation, smoking, obesity, and infrequent alcohol consumption. Multiple sclerosis, chronic fatigue syndrome, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, connective tissue disease, and diabetes were the top five long-term conditions associated with frailty (odds ratios, 15.3, 12.9, 5.6, 5.4, and 5, respectively). After adjustment for confounders, pre-frailty and frailty were significantly associated with mortality for all age strata in men and women (except for women aged 37 to 45 years).<br />"Efforts to identify, manage, and prevent frailty should include middle-aged individuals with multimorbidity, in whom frailty is significantly associated with mortality, even after adjustment for number of long-term conditions, sociodemographics, and lifestyle," the authors write.<br /
