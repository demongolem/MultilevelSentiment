Share<br />PRINCE RUPERT'S TOWER FACTFILE<br />Situated on Everton Brow in Everton, Liverpool, Prince Rupert's Tower was originally an overnight holding place for local criminals before its eventual closure.<br />The Georgian structure has been used on Everton's crest since 1938.<br />In 1997, Everton donated Â£15,000 to help renovate the structure, which is still commonly used in promotional campaigns by the club.<br />As part of the strip's launch, summer signing Richarlison was joined by team-mates Gylfi Sigurdsson, Leighton Baines and Tom Davies for a series of promotional pictures.<br />Manufacturers Umbro, meanwhile, also placed the kit on Prince Rupert's Tower and various other city centre locations.<br />'Involving fans in the kit design process has been an exciting and informative journey for us all here at Umbro. We're really proud of the jerseys that this whole process has delivered,' said Umbro Managing Director Anthony Little.<br />Speaking about the new strip, Everton left-back Leighton Baines said: 'I'm a big fan of the third kit. It reminds me of some of the great Umbro kits from when I was a kid.<br />'I think it's great that the fans were involved in designing it too, they've contributed to all three of our kits this season and that's brilliant because they wear it too and they should feel proud of it.<br />'I'm looking forward to wearing it on Saturday and hopefully we can get our first away win of the season in it.'<br />RELATED ARTICLES<br /
