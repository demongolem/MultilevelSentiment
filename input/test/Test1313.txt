Jarlin Garcia<br />, who departed with one out in the fifth after Atlanta&#8217;s Nick Markakis lined a comebacker into his lower right leg and the ball ricocheted into foul ground on the third-base side.<br />&#8220;Jarlin got hit pretty good,&#8221; said Marlins manager Don Mattingly, who indicated Garcia may miss some time. X-rays were negative.<br />Acuna got hit in the sixth, with the Braves already up 5-0.<br />was pitching for Miami, and the first seven pitches he threw were strikes.<br />The eighth wasn&#8217;t.<br />Guerra&#8217;s 94-mph fastball to Acuna was high and tight, and appeared to hit the Atlanta star around the left wrist. Acuna slammed his helmet to the ground and yelled, but eventually made his way to first without any bench-emptying reprise of what happened in Atlanta last week.<br />&#8220;I&#8217;d be angry too,&#8221; Braves manager Brian Snitker said. &#8220;It hurts. But he did exactly what he should do, go to first.&#8221;<br />Guerra said he was merely trying to place a pitch, not hit Acuna.<br />&#8220;We move on,&#8221; Guerra said.<br />The Braves evened things up on the hit-batter front in the bottom of the sixth.<br />Miami&#8217;s<br />Brian Anderson<br />got hit by Newcomb with two out. Braves catcher Tyler Flowers set up way inside â€” his glove behind Anderson, who took the pitch off the left arm. Home plate umpire Chris Conroy warned Newcomb, then both dugouts, and Anderson went quietly to first.<br />Anderson got hit again in the eighth, this time with a 78-mph curveball from<br />around the shin. Again, Anderson went to first without much in the way of extracurricular activity.<br />Mattingly said he doesn&#8217;t expect any carryover to the final three games of the series.<br />&#8220;It&#8217;s over,&#8221; Mattingly said.<br />TRAINER&#8217;S ROOM<br /
