The propionic acid segment is projected to be the largest during the forecast period
The Feed Acidifiers Market, by type, is estimated to be dominated by the propionic acid segment. Propionic acid is widely used as a dietary supplement and as a source of nutrition. Propionic acid is also used in the ensiling process for poultry feed, as it improves silage production and provides aerobic stability in silage. It also helps curb bacterial growth in molds, and hence, can also be used as a preservative in animal feed. The preservative effect of propionic acid thereby aids the prevention of feed nutrient losses and mycotoxin formation.
