found guilty<br />of eight counts of financial fraud.<br />The stories, and the different ways they were covered, played to the themes that Mr. Trump returns to frequently: illegal immigration and the crime and economic devastation he says it wreaks; a corrupted, one-sided justice system that he says punishes him and his allies but no one else; and a political system controlled by elites in both parties who he believes never accepted his victory.<br />Fox News set the tone for how prominently the Tibbetts story would feature in the media universe the president and his supporters follow most closely. As other networks covered the presidentâ€™s growing legal exposure, Fox alone broke in with news of Ms. Tibbettsâ€™s death. Its coverage of her disappearance, and of the discovery of her body, has been exhaustive, with correspondents on the scene in Iowa featuring in multiple segments every hour. On Wednesday night, the host who was filling in for Laura Ingraham opened the program by boasting, â€œFox News is the only network fully covering the case.â€�<br />That most other major news outlets paid the story comparatively little attention only gave Mr. Trump more ammunition to make his case that the media cannot be trusted.<br />Chris Buskirk, a conservative writer and radio host, summed up the attitude of many of Mr. Trumpâ€™s defenders. â€œSee, the mainstream media is at it again,â€� he said. â€œIn fact, letâ€™s do our fourth hour with Michael Avenatti,â€� he added, joking about the frequency with which Mr. Avenatti, a frequent critic of the president, appears on cable news shows.<br />Image<br />The immigration status of Cristhian Rivera, who was charged with killing Ms. Tibbetts, has been seized on by Republicans pushing for stricter laws.<br />Credit<br />Charlie Neibergall/Associated Press<br />The authorities have said that Mr. Rivera, the man charged in Ms. Tibbettsâ€™s death, was in the United States illegally. His lawyer has disputed that claim. Most social scientists who have looked at crime among immigrants have concluded that noncitizens are less likely to engage in criminal activity.<br />A recent study<br />by the libertarian-leaning Cato Institute, for example, found that in Texas, conviction and arrest rates for undocumented immigrants were lower than those for native-born Americans.<br />That has not stopped Mr. Trump, his White House or its supporters from suggesting otherwise. The administration regularly sends out emails to journalists with stories of immigrant crime, including one this week about<br />a killing in Minnesota<br />with the subject line, â€œAuthorities: Immigrant in U.S. illegally killed Shakopee woman, slashed own throat.â€�<br />Violent crimes by immigrants have become staples in conservative media, and Breitbart News and Fox News often lead the way. In February, for instance, after a young child was killed in North Carolina when an impaired driver hit the ambulance that was carrying him and his mother, Fox News and other right-wing outlets<br /
