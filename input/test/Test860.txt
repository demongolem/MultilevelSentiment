Aretha Franklin, the Queen of Soul, has died.
The singer-songwriter fell ill earlier this week , and died on 16 August as a result of pancreatic cancer.
She was 76.
Born in 1942 in Memphis, USA, Aretha Franklin's career spanned seven decades, and included hits like "Respect", "Natural Woman" and "I Say A Little Prayer".
Selling some 75-million records, there's no doubt that she had a massive impact on the music industry.
Celebrities took to Twitter on Thursday night to mourn her death, celebrate her life, and thank her for her contribution to society.
Former US President Barack Obama led the sentiment.
"Aretha helped define the American experience. In her voice, we could feel our history, all of it and in every shadeâ€”our power and our pain, our darkness and our light, our quest for redemption and our hard-won respect," he tweeted.
