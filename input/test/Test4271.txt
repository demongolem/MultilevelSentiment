Steamed: Robert Fulton didn't invent steamboats, but he was the first to commercialize them â€“ and his much-disparaged "Fulton's Folly" made its maiden voyage up the Hudson River, from New York Harbor to Albany, on Aug. 17, 1807.
Tightening up his IP: The first U.S. patent for an adjustable screw wrench was issued on this date in 1835 to Massachusetts inventor Solyman Merrick.
Prized moment: Newspaper publisher Joseph Pulitzer gifted $1 million to Columbia University on Aug. 17,1903, giving birth to the famous Pulitzer Prize.
Start your engines (literally): Inventor Charles Kettering earned a U.S. patent for the first electric automobile starter on Aug. 17, 1915.
Kettering â€“ who founded the Ohio-based Delco Electronics Corp. and co-founded the Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center after heading up research for both the NCR Corp. and General Motors â€“ is credited with 186 patents in all, including the invention of the first electric cash register, the refrigerant freon and the world's first aerial missile.
Stole its thunder: United States mail (123 letters, to be exact) was carried by hot-air balloon for the first time on Aug. 17, 1859, when the airship Jupiter lifted off from Lafayette, Ind., bound for New York City.
Unfortunately, severe weather â€“ including thunderstorms and strong southwest winds â€“ ended the flight after just 30 miles and the balloon put down in Crawfordsville, Ind. The swift completion of that appointed round was done by train.
Iron Horse: And on this date in 1933, New York Yankee Lou Gehrig set a new mark for consecutive Major League Baseball games played, appearing in his 1,103rd straight contest.
Gehrig was just getting started â€“ he'd play in another 1,027 straight, setting an iron-man record of 2,130 games that stood until 1995.
King of the wild frontier: American frontiersman and politician Davy Crocket (1786-1836) was born on Aug. 17.

BUT FIRST, THIS
Pavlov's dog in the hunt: Arguably the center of the universe regarding the study of the vagus nerve, the Feinstein Institute for Medical Research has added another sizeable score to its electric-nerve-stimulation war chest. Northwell Health's Manhasset-based research mecca announced Thursday that Professor Valentin Pavlov has received a five-year, $1.65 million grant from the National Institutes of Health to examine the vagus nerve's role in the inflammation and metabolism associated with sepsis.
The research will follow up previous work by Pavlov and bioelectric medicine pioneer Kevin Tracey, the Feinstein Institute CEO, showing the brain and the vagus nerve jointly control immune responses and inflammation â€“ essentially, the discovery of the so-called "inflammatory reflex."
While that research uncovered the vagus nerve's role in regulating inflammation throughout the body, "we do not know the exact neural signaling taking place during sepsis," Pavlov noted â€“ and understanding that "should help us identify new therapeutic targets, [which] could lead to new medications or bioelectronic medicine therapies for sepsis and its long-reaching sequelae."
