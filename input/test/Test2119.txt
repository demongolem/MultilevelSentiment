About WHO WE ARE
A husband and wife (plus one little guy), looking to make a difference where they can. We are Mike and Kristy - currently living on the East Coast of Australia - we believe we can make good change in the world one little gift at a time.
We are your average family, believing we can do some extraordinary things (with your help!). OUR MISSION
Our aim is too sell quality, stylish, and comfortable apparel, with profits being given to those in need. Our first recipient being a mission called Casa Vida - a place of refuge for children who have been victims of neglect or abuse, with projects in both East Timor and Bali.
We have have seen the impact of Casa Vida - bringing laughter to children who once had no reason to smile - and can think of no better recipient for financial support.
"Casa Vida's long term goal is to heal child victims of violence and abuse in a place of security, and facilitate their return with complete health and wholeness, into families and communities with a restored self-confidence and self-esteem."
On our own we haven't enough to give for long term support for Casa Vida, that's why we developed 'Fiks Clothing Co'. As a supportive incentive - you get quality apparel, and help support people that need it most! OUR VISION
Our Classic Collection Skater Cap is just the beginning in our eyes!
We plan to gradually expand our range - not just in hats, but with awesome apparel for you to be decked-out from head-to-toe. Artists will be commissioned for unique t-shirts and other tops, and our hat range will expand in both shape options and colour collections. WHERE WILL THE FUNDS GO?
If it is successful, the funds generated from this Kickstarter will go into a couple of places... funding an online store (for hopefully at least one year) - $624-$732 per year procuring stock (hats, embroidery, and packaging) - $20-$24 per hat (including packaging) any necessary legal/government expenses and hopefully our first official donation to Casa Vida!
