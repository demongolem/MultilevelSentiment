Kyle Walker warns rivals that Manchester City are hungry for more trophies Menu Kyle Walker warns rivals that Manchester City are hungry for more trophies 0 comments Kyle Walker has warned the Premier League that Manchester City are determined to "dominate English football" for years to come.
Pep Guardiola's men won the Premier League at a canter during a record-breaking 2017-18 season, reaching 100 points and finishing 19 clear of their nearest rivals Manchester United.
City also claimed the Carabao Cup but securing silverware has not softened the team's hunger for success as manager Guardiola works his players even harder.
Asked if Guardiola had been noticeably tougher, right-back Walker said: "Yeah, yeah, yeah! There's been a big change.

"Obviously, he's not striving for (just) one title and we're not as well â€“ we want more. I don't want to sound big headed, but we want to dominate English football.
"I think we've got the players here, and we've definitely got the manager, to do that, so we need to keep listening.
"Every day is a learning day and you can always adjust to different tactics, adjust to different formations and that's something we need to take on collectively as a group â€“ that's manager and players â€“ to make sure that we can dominate the English game."
It was quite the statement of intent from Walker after a first season to remember at City.
"I've not just signed here to pick up my first Premier League title and then say 'OK, I'll rest on that'," the England international said, speaking at the world premiere of All or Nothing: Manchester City, available on Amazon Prime Video from Friday.
"I'm hungry for a lot more. There's a lot of challengers, there are a lot of good teams in the Premier League.
"Even, you look at Everton now, who have spent a lot of money in the transfer window, they're going to be tough competitors.
"We just see the Premier League is full of surprises. Leicester did it so why can't anyone else do it? We'll just have to see."

Walker spoke with confidence rather than cockiness about City's chances â€“ little wonder after his domestic campaign and helping England to the World Cup semi-finals.
Gareth Southgate's trust in youth worked well in Russia and is sure to continue, with 18-year-old City academy graduate Phil Foden tipped to eventually star for club and country.
"There are a lot of experienced players in the dressing room who have won a lot of things here," Walker said.
"Even for me coming here, OK, I played a lot of Premier League games, but I didn't really win anything, so you have to show a little respect to the players who have gone and achieved what you want to achieve in your career. Phil Foden is one of England's brightest talents (Martin Rickett/PA)
"Obviously, Phil has been very fortunate in his first season around the squad to pick up a Premier League medal. Not many kids can say that they've done that.
"But he's not rested on that. He could have come back from the summer, not really trained hard, gone and partied or whatever â€“ which young kids do nowadays but he's not done that.
"He's been working hard â€“ you can see he's been working hard, he was even out in Russia so that's how much he loves the game of football.
"I saw a few Instagram posts of him when he was with (Ryan) Sessegnon and I think that just shows his enthusiasm for the game and it's great to see.
