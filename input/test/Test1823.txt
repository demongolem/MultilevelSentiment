We believe that adjusted net income helps identify underlying trends in our business by excluding the impact of share-based compensation expenses and fair value gains, which are non-cash charges. We believe that adjusted net income provides useful information about our operating results, enhances the overall understanding of our past performance and future prospects and allows for greater visibility with respect to key metrics used by our management in its financial and operational decision-making.<br />Adjusted net income is not defined under U.S. GAAP and are not presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP. This non-GAAP financial measure has limitations as analytical tools, and when assessing our operating performance, cash flows or our liquidity, investors should not consider them in isolation, or as a substitute for net (loss)/income, cash flows provided by operating activities or other consolidated statements of operation and cash flow data prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP.<br />We mitigate these limitations by reconciling the non-GAAP financial measure to the most comparable U.S. GAAP performance measure, all of which should be considered when evaluating our performance.<br />For more information on this non-GAAP financial measure, please see the table captioned &quot;Reconciliations of GAAP and non-GAAP results&quot; set forth at the end of this press release.<br />Exchange Rate Information<br />This announcement contains translations of certain RMB amounts into U.S. dollars (&quot;US$&quot;) at specified rates solely for the convenience of the reader.
