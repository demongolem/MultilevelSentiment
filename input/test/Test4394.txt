Amazon Web Services AWS SNS message integration into MySQL database
I currently have a custom real estate transaction system and I need to integrate AWS SNS messages from a third party into that system. Given the AWS access key information, I need someone to setup the SNS subscriptions and configure my application to receive the data and populate that data into an existing database. Basically;
- setup the AWS integration
- subscribe to a set of SNS messages
- create a table in the database to receive the messages
- confirm that everything is working
