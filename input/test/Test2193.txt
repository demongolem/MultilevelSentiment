Standing in a group of men recently I raised the subject of vasectomies. (I am such fun at parties.)
'They're so great!' I said, 'No hormones, worry free shagging!'* As I said the word, a groan went up around the assembled company. It was like I'd raised that scene in Casino Royal where the dude who cries blood goes at James Bond's crotch with a knotted rope.
*Apart from STIs, a vasectomy will not prevent you from catching STIs.
'Absolutely not' one friend said. 'No way.'
Which got me wondering. If you're someone who has finished having kids, or who never wants kids, why wouldn't you want to have a vasectomy? It's pretty much bullet proof as a method of contraception (99% effective), which means you don't have to worry about hormonal methods such as the pill, or spend time and money using condoms. To me, a non penis owner, it seems like the perfect form of contraception. Advertisement Advertisement
And yet, only 11,113 were performed in 2014/15 â€“ down from 31,216 in 2004/5 .
So, in the name of jizz journalism, I asked a load of men why they wouldn't have the snip.
'It just feels weird' David, 28 from London told me. 'I don't want to not be able to come.'
(Just as an FYI, having a vasectomy doesn't mean that you're unable to orgasmâ€¦)
'I don't want to come and have nothing coming out' said James. I explained that after a vasectomy there is still ejaculate when you orgasm, but that it's not filled with sperm.
'Yeah' he replied. 'But I'd know. It's just different.'
Thus far, I wasn't getting much in the way of information. I spoke to Carl, 35, who told me: 'I realise that it's probably not logical, but I don't like the idea of it. It's weird to take away my own power to reproduce. Maybe it's a male pride thing, but it just really freaks me out. Plus, I know it's not as invasive as a woman having her tubes tied, but it doesn't sound like a nice operation.' How a vasectomy works, according to the NHS Conventional vasectomy
The doctor first numbs your scrotum with a local anaesthetic. They then make 2 small cuts in the skin on each side of your scrotum to reach the tubes that carry sperm out of your testicles (vas deferens).
Each tube is cut and a small section removed. The ends of the tubes are then closed, either by tying them or sealing them using heat.
The cuts are stitched, usually using dissolvable stitches that go away on their own within about a week. No-scalpel vasectomy
The doctor first numbs your scrotum with local anaesthetic. They then make a tiny puncture hole in the skin of your scrotum to reach the tubes. This means they don't need to cut the skin with a scalpel.
The tubes are then closed in the same way as a conventional vasectomy, either by being tied or sealed.
There's little bleeding and no stitches with this procedure. It's thought to be less painful and less likely to cause complications than a conventional vasectomy.
Fair enough. After all, we all want autonomy over our own bodies, and it feels counter intuitive to have a medical procedure that isn't strictly necessary. But it does sound like there's some misinformation about what a vasectomy really involves. Advertisement Advertisement
Of course, there are lots of reasons, not based on a lack of information, that a man might not want to have the snip. One man, who shared his story anonymously with Metro.co.uk, said:
'My partner and I have a 4 year old son. In March we found out we were pregnant with twin boys. We spoke then about me having a vasectomy and I planned to see the doctor but didn't make the appointment. Last week we lost the twins at 28 weeks which means at this moment we are going through the hardest time in our lives. Seeing your tweet made me think that you never know what can happen and what is around the corner. What if I'd seen the doctor and jumped into a cancellation? Now we may never try again but at least I know that we can.'
And Greg, 43 told Metro.co.uk: 'I thought I was done with having children, but after my wife left me I was glad to have the option to have more children, otherwise my inability to could stop me from forming a relationship with someone I like who has kids.'
But, not all men are so anti the snip. Rafe, 38 told Metro.co.uk: 'Once my wife and I have had the number of kids we want, I would have a vasectomy. It seems logical and it would be great to be able to have unprotected sex without the worry of an unplanned child. I think men who are a bit squeamish about the idea probably haven't done the research and understood how the operation works.' Advertisement
So, if you're in a long term relationship and either done with having kids, or don't want kids, it can be great option and a very reliable form of contraception. But it is invasive, and can cause problems in how a man feels about his masculinity, so it's not a decision to be taken lightly.
If you're considering a vasectomy you should consult your GP. The procedure is free on the NHS. Some names have been changed to protect the anonymity of the men who gave their thoughts to this piece
