Often, teachers would ask Ms. Gunter to watch classrooms of students because of her maturity and ability to command a room's attention.

When a teacher would return to the classroom, she would leave, causing the students to misbehave because they wanted her to come back. Her positivity and sheer love for others continues to inspire many. Of her many roles, Ms. Gunter considers teaching the children and teens at Urgent Inc. to be the highlight of her career.
