Stock watch Treasury Wine Estates Morgan Stanley moved its rating on Treasury Wine Estates to equal-weight from overweight. The broker said that its valuation was now fair versus its global peers, there were risks to its US distribution changes, weakening China macro and a fading earnings upgrade cycle. On the back of the company's FY18 results, the broker noted operated cash flow conversion had deteriorated badly in the second half and the analysts now believe that earnings quality has deteriorated. Morgan Stanley said that Treasury's primary growth engines remain in Asia and the Americas. The broker said that while there were very strong growth prospects for the company, it believed there would be better buying opportunities in the future. Morgan Stanley retained its price target of $20.
What moved the market Shanghai composite The bad news for the Shanghai Composite index may not be over, even as the index fell for the fourth session in a row on Thursday. The index is now sitting at close to its lowest level this year and has declined roughly 18 per cent since the start of the year. By comparison, other emerging markets are only marginally lower for the year, putting the Shanghai Composite firmly in bear market territory. Capital Economics' chief markets economist John Higgins highlighted in a recent note that the loss wasn't coming from just one sector. "The slide has been broad-based," he said. "Aside from industrials, all sectors of the index have plummeted by at least 17 per cent since this year's peak."
Copper Industrial metals have clawed back some gains following the worst session in three years on the London Metal Exchange. The two key issues that had plagued commodities in the previous session appear to be now turning around. On Thursday, it was announced that low-level trade talks would resume between China and the United States. Meanwhile, Turkey's currency appears to be recovering from its lows with two strong sessions strengthening the lira against the US dollar. Copper, widely seen as an indicator of global industrial sentiment, lifted 2.5 per cent on Thursday on the London Metal Exchange, although it is still down 4.8 per cent for the week.
Turkish lira The Turkish lira has lifted from its record low at the start of this week as sentiment around the country's economic management lifts. The lira was the best performing emerging market currency on Thursday as it rose on the back of positive sentiment coming from the Turkish government. On Friday morning the lira lifted further after Turkey's finance minister Berat Albayra addressed thousands of international investors, vowing to protect the local banks and cut spending to prevent the country falling into further financial turmoil. Albayra, who was appointed to his position by his father-in-law, president Recep Tayyip ErdoÄŸan, said the country could turn to Germany or China for help if the US imposed sanctions against them.
Aussie dollar The recent fall in the Australian dollar may not be over according to Capital Economics chief Australia & New Zealand economist Paul Dales who says that the ongoing issues in emerging markets could weigh the currency. While he expects the dollar to continue to trade at around $US72 cents, he hasn't ruled out the currency falling further. "Our non-consensus call that the Australian dollar would weaken significantly this year has been vindicated by the fall to a 19-month low of US$0.72 this week," he said. "And with the dollar currently being dragged down by a deterioration in sentiment towards China, emerging markets and risky assets in general, it could easily fall below US$0.70 in the coming months.
