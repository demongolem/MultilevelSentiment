New Enterprise Ireland "Prepare to Export Scorecard" for companies with global ambition
Interactive online tool helps potential exporters assess their export-readiness.
A new Prepare to Export Scorecard has been developed by Enterprise Ireland to help Irish entrepreneurs and business owners with global ambition to self-assess how prepared they are to start exporting. The interactive online facility is a free, easy-to-use tool which acts as a starting point for companies interested in exporting and reaching overseas markets.
The Prepare to Export Scorecard analyses answers submitted to a range of questions and generates an immediate report. The on-the-spot assessment focuses on the company's level of export-readiness across six key business pillars: business planning, people management, operations, sales and marketing, innovation, and finance. Users can opt to submit their report and request to be personally contacted by the Enterprise Ireland exporter development team.
By focusing on key aspects of business, the Prepare to Export Scorecard helps emerging and potential exporters to consider where to start as well as defining the practical steps that can be taken to plan and begin their export journey. The tool also includes a peer learning element allowing users to access video case studies in which fellow SME teams share their learnings from planning and implementing their export strategies.
Minister for Business, Enterprise and Innovation, Heather Humphreys TD said:
"Many Irish companies have the talent and ambition to succeed in global markets, but do not know how to get started. Therefore, I welcome the launch of Enterprise Ireland's new Prepare to Export Scorecard, which aims to help companies not only assess their current position, but to identify practical steps that they can take to become export ready. I particularly welcome the on-line tool showing good practices in export strategies. To be resilient in the face of potential economic shocks, such as Brexit, Irish exporting companies need to be innovative, competitive and have a diversified global footprint. The new Prepare to Export Scorecard is an important addition to the existing range of supports available through Enterprise Ireland in that regard." Leave a Repl
