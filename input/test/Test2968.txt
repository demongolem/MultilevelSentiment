Frieze Sculpture has returned to The Regent's Park in London for three months. The artwork display, which began on July 4, 2018 will be on view through October 7, 2018.
Frieze Sculpture has featured works by 25 Contemporary and Modern artists from five continents. Larry Achiampong, James Capper, John Baldessari, Rana Begum, Haroon Gunn-Salie, Virginia Overton, Dan Graham, Monika Sosnowska, Richard Woods and Bharti Kher are some of the artists among others. Following the success of Frieze Sculpture 2017, the event has introduced some new features this year. "Last year, our first-ever summer Frieze Sculpture was a resounding success, with more than five million visitors enjoying exceptional sculpture by artists from around the world. The 2018 edition is just as expansive and diverse so that the public and collectors alike can experience world-class artwork in the beautiful English Gardens, designed by Markham Nesfield in 1866," said Clare Lilley, director of Program at Yorkshire Sculpture Park.
Before the art fair began, Lilley commented on the additions made this year and stated, "Artists of different generations and from across the world â€“ including a strong female contribution â€“ will come together and explore multiple concepts, spanning political and architectural ideas, animal forms and material experimentation."
The logistics partner for Frieze Sculpture, Mtec, has covered the cost of installation for two emerging galleries, Hannah Barry Gallery and Copperfield. Frieze Sculpture 2018 has collaborated with mobile platform ARTimbarc for the launch of a new audio tour and family guide app. This year, Frieze Sculpture Family Trail is produced to help children explore the artworks. The guide is illustrated by Emily Rand and is activated with family days in the park, led by the Royal Society of Sculptors.
Artistic director of Frieze London and Frieze Sculpture, Jo Stella-Sawicka said, "This year we welcome major international galleries, with large-scale works by an exceptionally diverse group of contemporary artists, including a significant number of living women sculptors â€“ from Tracey Emin and Bharti Kher to Kimsooja. I'm equally delighted that for the first time, we can enable two of London's fantastic emerging galleries to present ambitious outdoor works with the generous support of our logistics partner for Frieze Sculpture, Mtec."
Some of the major highlights of the art fair include Dan Graham's glass pavilion, Tracey Emin's five-piece bird sculpture series, and Rana Begum's colorful glass installation.
