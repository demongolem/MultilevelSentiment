Simplybe Clearance Top tips for buying tech on eBay.co.uk
Consider refurbished goods â€“ Focus on searching for brands you are familiar with - and items you've seen in real life. Many brands such as Dyson and GoPro are refurbishing their own items and selling them directly on eBay, so always look out for big name brands.
Do your research â€“ Has there been a new release or is there a cheaper alternative to the item you want? You're not restricted to buying the latest handsets if you don't need them, so be sure to look at reviews and compare handsets to find the best model for you.
Check the warranty and returns policy â€“ One of the most important things to consider when buying refurb is the warranty it comes with, as this provides you protection if it develops a fault. If you shop from eBay's refurbished hub all items come with a 12-month warranty from the seller, so if anything does go wrong in the 12 months you can guarantee that you will get an exchange or a refund.
Examine Seller Feedback - Always check seller feedback, making sure they have a good feedback rating. eBay's top rated sellers constantly receive the highest buyer ratings, dispatch items quickly and have earned a track record of brilliant service.
Make the most of free shipping - Save yourself some money by looking for sellers that offer free shipping with the item. On eBay.co.uk you can filter your search to see only items that offer free shipping, and with many electronic items small enough to be shipped inexpensively, it's a great way to save a few extra pennies.
