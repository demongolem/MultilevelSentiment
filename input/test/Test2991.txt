Twitter removes key features in third-party apps San Francisco: In its bid to deliver better experiences for its users, Twitter has removed support for some outdated but key developer tools in third-party apps.
In a blog post on Thursday, Twitter said it will remove access to application programme interfaces (APIs) needed to power push notifications and an auto-refreshing timeline.
"We've chosen to stop investing in other products a" including two legacy developer tools used by about 1 per cent of third-party developers. This means that some Twitter-like apps will not be able to function the exact same way as before," said Rob Johnson, Director of Product at Twitter.
The changes will affect third-party Twitter apps including Tweetbot, Twitterrific, Talon and Tweetings.
Instead of tweets automatically streaming in like they once did in some third-party apps, users will now need to pull to refresh like they do in Twitter-owned apps and sites.
"We've removed support for Twitter for Apple Watch and Twitter for Mac, weaÃ¯Â¿Â½ve replaced our previous Twitter for Windows app with our Progressive Web App, and now, we're removing support for some outdated developer tools," Johnson informed
