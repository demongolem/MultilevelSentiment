Other Sports COLLIE MORAN Dublin's machine-like dominance of Gaelic football has gotten a bit boring and left the game in urgent need of review
There used to be great excitement ahead of All-Ireland semi-finals but the poor crowds at both games show the game isn't a great place Comment By Collie Moran 16th August 2018, 10:38 pm THERE used to be great excitement and chat over a few pints with the Ballyboden lads after Dublin games.
But we were in Gill's pub beside Croke Park after the Galway game last weekend and one of the lads said to me, 'It's all getting a bit boring, isn't it?' Dublin cruised to victory over Galway in the All-Ireland semi-final
I couldn't disagree because it was a fair summary of football these days.
It wasn't a criticism of Dublin, far from it, but football generally.
He was making the point that Dublin turn up game after game, year after year, and grind the opposition into submission.
They generally pull away in the second half and win by eight or 10 points. Dublin pull away in the second half and win by eight or 10 points
And more if it's a Leinster Championship game.
It was exciting initially because they were doing it in a swashbuckling style but Dublin have been a machine for the last few years.
They play the percentages and make very few mistakes. They'll hold on to the ball and pass it around and wait for an opening instead of kicking a ball into the forwards which might end up in a 50-50 contest.
That's great for Jim Gavin and the players themselves because they're probably going to win four-in-a-row.
But the game as a whole isn't in a great place and needs an urgent review.
If you boil it all right down, what we've really missed this summer is those 50-50 contests between the top players.
We used to get that all the time â€” two midfielders going up for a kickout, a full-forward taking on a big full-back. That's what made the game great.
But it's been stripped right back and Dublin figured out long ago that it's much more important to be efficient than exciting. I was sitting in the Cusack Stand last weekend and couldn't believe all the empty seats for an All-Ireland semi-final. 4 Croke Park had plenty of empty seats for both All-Ireland semi-finals
There was only 54,000 at the game â€” the same as what we used to get for a Leinster quarter-final against Wexford or Westmeath.
It was the same for the Monaghan-Tyrone semi-final with less than 50,000 there.
For the first time I can remember, there was more at the hurling semi-finals with over 70,000 at the Cork-Limerick clash.
Football is a major crossroads and I feel it's time for radical change.
It can still be saved because despite all the negativity this year there's been some big positives.
The black card is proving a big success, the mark has added to the game and bringing Championship football to regional grounds in the Super Eights worked a treat.
Newbridge was rocking when Kildare played Galway, there was a pitch invasion when Monaghan won in Salthill and fans had great experiences in places like Omagh and Ballybofey.
But what's clear to me is that the game itself, and how it's played, has advanced at a much faster rate than the rule-book. All the county teams have analysts crunching the numbers and coming up with the most efficient way. They're cutting down on errors but losing our interest.
We've had a summer of short kickouts, endless hand passing and patient build-up play â€” all of which is terribly boring. That's why Croke Park was half-empty last Saturday and Sunday.
A few tweaks would make all the difference, like demanding that all kickouts cross the 45-metre line, introducing an offensive mark and insisting on a limited number of players inside their own 45. A few tweaks to the rules could make all the difference
All of those things would bring back the one thing that football is missing â€” individual battles.
That's where hurling is killing football and providing genuine excitement and 50-50s close to goal.
One great catch and a full-forward is in for a goal. In football, it might take five minutes for a full-forward to get into the same position.
The other big success of hurling is the amount of games played between teams of the same standard.
Football, in comparison, continues to give us three or four mismatches for every one competitive game we get.
That's where I feel the most radical change is needed â€” to the structure. Paraic Duffy talked about the Super Eights being a stepping stone to something bigger and I hope it is.
My proposal is that they scrap the National League and run a Championship based on three groups of 11 with promotion and relegation between them.
Everyone gets five home games and five away games, the top four go through to the All-Ireland semi-finals, the bottom four play off to produce two relegated teams.
It'd be like an expanded Super Eights and you could run the provincial championships alongside, like the FA Cup running in parallel to the leagues in England.
If hurling has taught us anything this summer, it's that evenly-matched teams playing regular games is what everyone wants.
The other big benefit from what I'm proposing is that you'd have your fixtures nailed down and could give meaningful space then for the club programme.
People will say it's too radical and that you'll never get it through Congress but what's the alternative?
Sit on our hands as attendances go through the floor?
You'd be hard pushed to pick three or four really memorable football games from the summer. If we don't get a really good final it'll go down as a forgettable Championship for the neutrals.

That's not a sustainable situation going forward.
The Super Eights has come in for three years but can we afford to leave things as they are that long?
It needs a debate right now, as soon as the Championship is over, between the GAA, the GPA and the CPA
