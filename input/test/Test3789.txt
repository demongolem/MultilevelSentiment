Submitted by venkateshiarc . According to the new market research report by IndustryARC titled " Agricultural Drones Market By Rotor Type, By Battery Life, By Applications & Geography â€“ Forecast (2018 - 2023) " , the market growth will be enhanced by the growing trends of automated farming practices worldwide. North America will dominate the Agricultural Drones Market North America will dominate the Agricultural Drones Market in the forecast period. This is due to the implementation of UAVs for enhanced productivity. The increasing awareness of precision agriculture for field mapping and crop scouting has compelled the farmers to use UAVs in the farming. Asia Pacific will record the highest growth in the future due to the increasing technological access in the rural parts of the region and innovations in the farming practices. The increased venture funding for the UAV manufacturers in Asia Pacific has also boosted the growth of the agricultural drone technology. Different companies in the region are manufacturing economical UAVs for more applications in the agricultural fields. Selected Regulatory Analysis Done in the Full Report: The field mapping application segment dominates the agricultural drones market. Benefits, such as, increasing the yields by analysing the crops will fuel the field mapping application segment. Drones can spray fertilizers without disturbing the soil fertility. This factor propels the growth of the crop scouting segment. Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), with respect to crop scouting, contributes to the growth of the market. NDVI uses infrared sensors to monitor the progress of the crop and capture the data that cannot be captured by the human eye. Hybrid UAVs will have the highest growth in the coming years due to their ability of covering long distances over the fields. Economical navigation and visualisation, which includes inspection and mapping assists the farmers in monitoring their fields. Selected Driving Factors Mentioned in the Full Report The Internet of Things is a launch pad for the drone sensors. This factor drives the demand for drone aerial spraying in the forecast period. The popularity of agricultural drone technology has increased among farmers due to its vast applications. Quick availability of information and low cost operations will enhance the growth of the UAV sprayer. Ability of the agro drones in monitoring farm and weather conditions will boost their growth in the future. Request for table of contents of the full report by providing your details in the below link
