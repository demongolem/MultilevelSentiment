Eduardo Nunez<br />poked a double down the first-base line to make it 6-0.<br />Martinez singled in a run in the sixth â€” his major league-leading 109th RBI of the season â€” to give Boston a 7-0 lead.<br />DEFENSIVE HELP<br />Swihart entered the game as a pinch-runner in the first after first baseman Mitch Moreland aggravated an existing knee injury sliding for a foul ball. In addition to driving in the go-ahead run for the second straight game, he also had a nice scoop when Price made a bad throw to first on<br />Roberto Perez<br />&#8216;s comebacker in the sixth.<br />Price knocked the ball down with his glove and scrambled behind the mound to get it, then bounced a throw to Swihart, who was playing in just the sixth game of his career at the position. The ball bounced off Swihart&#8217;s glove but he grabbed it with his bare hand just in time to beat the runner.<br />Price also got some help when second baseman<br />made an over-the-shoulder catch in shallow right in the fifth inning. And Swihart started a 3-6 double play in the eighth.<br />LOST IN THE SUN<br />Melky Cabrera<br />lost Moreland&#8217;s fly ball in the sun in the first inning, waving for help from his infielders before ducking out of the way of the ball. Moreland was safe with a single, giving the Red Sox runners on first and second with one out.<br />Plutko struck out Martinez and Bogaerts to escape.<br />TRAINERS ROOM<br />Neil Ramirez<br />(lower back spasms) on the 10-day DL.<br />Red Sox: Moreland left the game with a bruised left knee after sliding near a photo pit in pursuit of<br />&#8216;s foul popup in the first. Moreland remained in the game, but left for Swihart in the bottom of the first.<br />UP NEXT<br />Indians: Open a three-game series at Kansas City, with righty Mike Clevinger (9-7) facing righty Brad Keller (6-5).<br />Red Sox: Travels to Tampa Bay for a three-game set.
