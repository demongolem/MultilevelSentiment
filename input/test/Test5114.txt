Send to a friend The Tourism Business Council of South Africa (TBCSA) has announced Tshifhiwa Tshivhengwa as interim ceo, effective August 15. TBCSA Board Chairman, Blacky Komani , says: "We are pleased to have Tshifhiwa Tshivhengwa on board. Whilst the process of appointing a permanent head for the organisation continues, we believed it was important for the business council to have someone of his calibre to continue steering the ship in the direction required by the new board." Tshivhengwa is currently ceo of the Federated Hospitality Association of Southern Africa (Fedhasa), and has over 17 years' experience in international marketing, business development and international trade relations, among others. Over the years he has worked for brands such as South African Tourism, Myriad Marketing, Protours, SARS, and HRG Rennies Travel. This has built up a strong grounding of tourism knowledge, along with a keen sense of strategic focus and versatile business judgment gained during his work in Los Angeles, New York, and South Africa. Tshivhengwa is also a board member of the Tourism BBBEE Charter Council and is a former board member of the Tourism Grading Council. The TBCSA has entered into an agreement with Fedhasa that allows Tshivhengwa to take up the position of TBCSA interim ceo in addition to his current role. His critical function within the TBCSA will be to oversee its day-to-day operations and assist the business council to assume its leadership role in the travel and tourism sector. "With the new board and interim ceo in place, we are confident that the business council has taken the right steps to reset itself as the one voice for travel and tourism in South Africa," concludes Komani. eTN
