Day 3,220 life Menu and widgets
I take at least one photograph every day and post it to this site and to my Instagram and Twitter feeds (see below). I upload when I have time, typically six or seven days after the image is captured. Postings here and to my Instagram and Twitter feeds are lumpy, but I do actually photograph every day.
I started this project on October 16, 2009 and have posted a picture taken each day without a miss. I'm into my ninth year of this long-term project, which I've committed to continue for the rest of my life.
