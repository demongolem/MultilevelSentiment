News Feed's "integrity" team based in Menlo Park, California, handles prototypical fake news like hoax articles and doctored images, for instance.<br />"Last year was very much about trying to reduce the amount of false news on the platform, reduce the bad," Brown says. This year, the news teams have begun to focus on "elevating the good," she says. They're focusing now on the programs and features to help legitimate news thrive on -- and off -- Facebook.<br />Brown herself acknowledges her biggest fear is they are too slow.<br />"Mark always says move faster, but I worry we can't move fast enough, as fast as we need to," Brown says.<br />Slow creep<br />Nick Golebiewski<br />"Elevating the good" may seem less thorny than dealing with malevolent hoaxes, but, really, all of Facebook's interaction with news is fraught. As a journalist sitting in on weekly meetings of the news products team, I was heartened by how much it advocates for people like me, before being completely creeped out by just how much Facebook knows.<br />Under Hardiman's direction, the news products team tries to be genuine advocates for journalists inside Facebook. Hardiman repeatedly reminds team members about unintended ways new Facebook features may lose money for news organizations. Make sure the video team is keeping publishers in mind as they build a new format, she instructs them.<br />But in a discussion of how Facebook could help journalists on the ground, I got twinges of Orwellian unease. Facebook isn't Big Brother, but it has nearly as much detailed insight into our lives. Almost all of it is detail that we -- its billions of users, journalists included -- voluntarily surrender. Even when that insight is deployed for good, it's creepy.<br />Generally speaking, "elevating the good" includes identifying trusted, informative outlets and prioritizing them in News Feed. Hardiman's team also espouses "collaborative product design." It works directly with news organizations as they build, so the results actually suit publishers' needs.<br />The progress has been slow.<br />"The only area I've seen positive light -- and I don't know just because it's so early -- is local," says Jason Kint, the chief of a trade group representing digital publishers, Digital Content Next. (Disclosure: CBS Interactive, which publishes CNET, is one of Digital Content Next's 60-plus members.)<br />Kint means local news, which has been the recipient of Facebook's most substantive initiatives so far. Brown's partnerships team launched a Local News Subscriptions Accelerator in February. The $3.5 million, three-month pilot program helps metropolitan newspapers with digital subscriptions.<br />The accelerator lines up well with the paywalls that Hardiman's team is testing with a small group of publishers. In it, a Facebook user who reads multiple stories from the same publisher in Instant Articles, a mobile layout for stories, hits a limit on free reading. The paywall links to the outlet's own site, where the reader can subscribe directly.<br />Paywalls, at least, demonstrate Facebook has been chastened enough to change. Instant Articles banned paywalls initially. Zuckerberg disapproved of them,<br />asking how tollbooths create a more open and connected world<br />. Now Facebook is doubling down on the accelerator concept with a second $3.5 million program later this year to help nonprofit and local news organizations.<br />Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook's founder and CEO, initially dismissed the notion that fake news on Facebook had a role in the US presidential election as a "pretty crazy idea."<br />James Martin/CNET<br />Hardiman says some of Facebook's efforts are beginning to show "some really good early signs." A test called<br />Today In<br />, which gathers local news and information into a dedicated place on the social network, has increased publishers' distribution by 8 percent on average.<br />But the slow pace of progress is partly because collaborative design takes extra time and effort. It'd be faster for the team to stick to its own instincts and barrel through changes without any outside input, in more typical Facebook fashion.<br />But Hardiman has seen how that fell flat when she was on the other side. In 2015, she was The New York Times' vice president of new products when Facebook launched Instant Articles. "The key proposition was that it was really fast," she recalls. "I was like, 'OK, I just rebuilt our entire mobile website to be really fast.' You're not listening."<br />Weapon of choice<br />As far as "reducing the bad," Facebook's fumbles with Alex Jones underscore the company's weaknesses reining in fake news itself.<br />Jones' Infowars assumes the guise of a news organization to prolifically deliver conspiracy theories. It built a following of millions of people on Facebook but also had a track record of violating Facebook's rules on hate speech and harassment.
