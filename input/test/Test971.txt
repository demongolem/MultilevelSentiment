Adirondack Scenic Railroad plans rail bike operations soon Aug 17, 2018 at 5:15 AM
UTICA â€” The Adirondack Scenic Railroad plans to expand with a rail bike operation soon.
Officials with the organization recently tested the first four-seat rail bike prototype with a ride from Charlie's Inn at Lake Clear Junction to Saranac Lake Depot. The bike reportedly performed flawlessly, officials said.
"This is really a one of a kind experience," said Mark Piersma, director of marketing and public relations at Adirondack Scenic Railroad. "It's a unique experience."
Piersma described the rail bikes as paddle boats for the railway. Each bike has four seats with four wheels on the rails.
The bikes have four sets of pedals that can be peddled individually. Basically, this means that everyone does not have to peddle to move the bike. If someone gets tired, he or she can stop and others can continue to peddle and move the bike down the track.
The rail bikes are made in Utica.
Currently, the organization has three bikes set to use, with new bikes â€” which are slated to include small motors to help propel the rider â€” in the future.
The rail bikes are on a 6-mile stretch of tracks between Thendara Station and Carter Station, both in the Old Forge area.
"The vistas are outstanding," Piersma said of the scenery viewable during the ride.
Riders are not required to travel both ways, Piersma said. It is possible for riders to start at either station and then get a ride back.
"If you take a one-way trip we will bring you back by train," Piersma said. "It offers two different perspectives of the track."
Piersma said the group had spent a long process looking into using the rail bikes on the tracks. This means people of all abilities can use the bikes.
"In my opinion, anyone can do this," Piersma said. "It's really easy to do."
Jack Roberson, executive director of the Adirondack Scenic Railroad, said in a release that the rail bikes operation is just about set.
"We are looking forward to beginning production of the finalized version of the bike and starting business," he said. "We have a few cosmetic changes to make, but otherwise, everything looks great."
People looking to book a trip on the rail bikes can make reservations at adirondackrr.com. Officials expect the reservations to go quick.
The group is expected to introduce rail bike service in Saranac Lake in the near future. Rail bike service in Saranac Lake was terminated in 2016 after New York said the rail line should close.
The railroad has been at odds with the state and other groups for a number of years over rail vs. trail concepts.
The Adirondack Railway Preservation Society, which oversees the railroad, wanted to connect the railroad from Tupper Lake to Lake Placid. It filed a lawsuit in April 2016 challenging the state's proposed 34-mile trail project. The project has sought to replace 34 miles of track with a multi-use recreational trail connecting the villages of Tupper Lake, Saranac Lake and Lake Placid.
In September, Judge Robert Main in Franklin County released a written decision in the lawsuit against the proposed Adirondack rail trail, ruling in favor of preserving the existing railway between Lake Placid and Tupper Lake.
Prior to the ruling, the DEC had been moving forward with the trail's development. A conceptual design was released in May, while DEC officials hosted a number of public information sessions that same month in Saranac Lake, Tupper Lake and Lake Placid.
The state in April declined to appeal the ruling.
