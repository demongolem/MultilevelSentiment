We're into four minutes of added time and it's Wednesday who are pushing... 16:47 Philip Buckingham The final throes
David Marshall is called into action once more to deal with Fernando Forestieri's drive from a tight angle. The Scot has done his bit in keeping City in this.
It'll certainly be the Tigers who are more grateful for the point if it stays like this. 16:44 Philip Buckingham Almost a stunner from Henriksen
City have barely troubled the Sheffield Wednesday goal in this second half but they almost won it with a screamer. Markus Henriksen from all of 35 yards forces Cameron Dawson to tip over. From the resulting corner it's another near miss. Jordy De Wijs' effort is deflected wide. 16:41 Philip Buckingham City's last sub
The hard-working Fraizer Campbell knows his afternoon is up and ambles slowly off the Hillsborough turf. Nouha Dicko gets the last nine minutes plus stoppages. 16:37 Philip Buckingham Wednesday close again
Hull City really are putting their fans through it now. No-one gets close enough to the tricky Fernando Forestieri inside the penalty area and his low drive is diverted past the upright by David Marshall. Too close for comfort. 16:31 Philip Buckingham More changes
Nigel Adkins has turned to Jon Toral's guile off the bench in a swap for Dan Batty.
Wednesday are also busy on the sidelines. Marco Mathias is on for the wasteful Steven Fletcher. 16:27 Fletcher misses again
Steven Fletcher should really have a hat-trick, without a hint of exaggeration.
The third chance is arguably the easiest. City are stretched at the back as Adam Reach crosses from deep but the striker sends a header harmlessly over the top.
The Tigers living dangerously. Philip Buckingham Sub for City
Jackson Irvine is coming on for his first appearance of the season, replacing Evandro. You can see the logic in that one. Beefing up midfield. 16:19 Philip Buckingham City trying to regroup
The Tigers have to take a deep breath. All the things they did well in the first half are no longer. They're panicked in possession and balls are going astray. Nigel Adkins looks concerned.

Steven Fletcher ought to have headed Wednesday in front. A corner is sent deep from the right and kept alive by a towering header but Fletcher, in too much space, cannot direct the header back into the far corner. A second big chance missed by the Scot. 16:12 Philip Buckingham Test for City now
This is a big 10 minutes for City. Having enjoyed most of the first half, they've now got to weather what you suspect will be a Wednesday storm. They're attacking the Kop and it's very different atmosphere now. 16:09 KEY EVENT GOAL: Sheffield Wednesday 1 Hull City 1
Penalty to Sheffield Wednesday and Fernando Forestieri is the coolest man in Hillsborough. Forestieri was initially fouled by Reece Burke and Stuart Attwell pointed straight the spot. Perhaps a touch harsh on Burke but you can see why it's been given. 16:07 Here's 10 of the best pictures from the first half 16:04 KEY EVENT KICK-OFF
Jos Luhukay, who has the look of a TV detective, cannot have been happy with that first half from his Wednesday side. He'll be demanding better. As for Nigel Adkins? More of the same. Hull City manager Nigel Adkins arrives at Hillsborough (Image: Focus ) 15:49 KEY EVENT HALF-TIME
So far, so good. Hull City lead 1-0 thanks to Fraizer Campbell's clinical finish nine minutes before the interval. Not a lot between the sides but the visitors have certainly shown more fluency in the final third. Wednesday fans are growing irritable, which can only be a good thing.

The ultimate indignity for Morgan Fox. Booked as he's getting subbed with an injury. Poor challenge on Fraizer Campbell but that's the last we'll see of him. Jordan Thornily is the replacement. 15:44 Here's the moment that splits the teams
Bang. Fraizer Campbell makes it 1-0 to Hull City away to Sheffield Wednesday (Image: Focus) 15:42 Philip Buckingham City pushing for a second
Wednesday are wobbling now they're behind and it's almost 2-0 for City. Todd Kane's right-wing corner is turned on towards goal by Markus Henriksen but the effort is blocked. The natives in blue and white are growing restless. More O
