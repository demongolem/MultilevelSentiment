BISMARCKâ€”A fire alarm added six minutes of excitement to an otherwise calm debate between the two party nominees for North Dakota's lone House seat.
Republican Kelly Armstrong and Democrat Mac Schneider teed off Thursday night, Aug. 16, in Bismarck in their second debate of the House race, hosted by the Greater North Dakota Chamber and moderated by KFYR.
Like their previous debate in May, their responses revealed similar positions, extending to tariffs, federal regulations on industry, southern border security and election integrity, to name a few.
Where they identified their differences were in a few legislative votes, views on abortion and a Texas federal lawsuit, to which North Dakota is a party, to overturn the Affordable Care Act.
Armstrong pointed to "draconian" federal regulations as the biggest issue facing North Dakota. Schneider said he agreed with reducing federal regulations, and offered up the Trump administration's imposed tariffs on longtime trade partners and passing a bipartisan Farm Bill as major issues.
Armstrong, an attorney and Dickinson lawmaker, took issue with Schneider's "misconceptions" describing him as in support of the trade war, but said he favors the opportunity to renegotiate trade agreements, while opposing long-term tariffs and farmers and ranchers made out as "pawns."
Schneider invoked "short-term pain" in low commodity prices and "long-term pain" in loss of markets that took decades to cultivate: "I have been clear since Day 1 that a trade war is against the interests of North Dakota."
The candidates also found agreement on southern border security, with Schneider suggesting an investment in human intelligence and law enforcement, quipping that "for every 15-foot wall, there's a 17-foot ladder."
Armstrong said "a wall needs to be a part of that conversation," and highlighted Dickinson's Fisher Industries, which has a developed a prototype of a wall for the southern border. He also said North Dakota technology and industry has the capacity to meet the needs for border security, such as unmanned aerial systems.
"North Dakota could secure this border all by ourselves. We wouldn't even need the other 49 states to do it," he said. "This has never been a matter of whether (the U.S.) can do it. It is matter of whether or not we have the political will to do it."
Both candidates pointed to solving workforce needs and legal immigration as well in response to the question on border security.
"I'm a fan of the president saying let's be smart and tough," Schneider said.
On abortion, Armstrong stood on his anti-abortion views from his Catholic heritage, while Schneider said he would "reject ideological responses of both sides."
"There are no easy answers to such an emotional issue that overlaps faith, science and a woman's body," he said.
The two also differed on North Dakota's entry into the lawsuit against the ACA. Schneider said it threatens health care protections for pre-existing conditions as well as state Medicaid expansion from 2013.
Armstrong highlighted previous programs such as the Comprehensive Health Association of North Dakota that existed before the ACA, and stood up for Attorney General Wayne Stenehjem's entry into the suit.
He was responding to Schneider on the question of health care when the fire alarm sounded (there was no fire). Little of the debate was left, however: just Schneider's rebuttal on health care and both candidates' closing statements. Additional Articles Recommended by The Dickinson Pres
