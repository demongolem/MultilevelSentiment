NAGPUR: Former Vidarbha cricketer TH Naidu has fond memories of Ajit Wadekar . The legendary cricketer passed away in Mumbai on Wednesday. In shock after the news of Wadekar's demise, Naidu relived the day spent with the former India captain at Shivaji Park, the home of Mumbai cricket .
"It is a big emotional loss. I can't imagine one of my teammates, who retired as one of the greatest cricketers the country has seen, is no more," Naidu, who played two first-class matches for Vidarbha, told TOI on Thursday.
"For more than a decade I played under him for the Shivaji Park Gymkhana team. It was the most memorable phase of my playing career. Apart from Wadekar, we had greats like Ramakant Desai, Baloo Gupte, Vijay Manjrekar in our team," Naidu added.
"He was an insightful skipper. I have never seen him scolding anyone. His behavior was calm, but his batting was equally aggressive.
"Whenever I got a chance to play among the stalwarts, I batted in the middle-order. I was a defensive batsman. Wadekar used to tell me to play freely," Naidu said.
Wadekar played a Test and a Duleep Trophy match in Civil Lines Stadium in Nagpur. In fact, Wadekar's only international appearance here came in the first Test match hosted by the city in 1969. Mansur Ali Khan Pataudi was the captain of that Indian team which lost to New Zealand by 167 runs.
Later, Wadekar visited city as coach of Team India. It was during this time that former VCA president Prakash Dixit met the legendary cricketer. "I met him during one of the matches in Nagpur. I was part of VCA's BCCI reception committee and that's how we met for the first time.
"He was coach of the Indian team during that period. We immediately got along. Whenever he would come to the city, we used have lunch or dinner together," Dixit said.
"Despite being such a big personality, he was very down to earth. He would never refuse anyone asking for an autograph. Many people didn't know that post his retirement, he worked a lot for the physically challenged cricketers," Dixit added.
"Last time, he came here for a private trip with his wife and family. I suggested that he visit Tadoba. Though he couldn't, he called me earlier this year and said his son was interested in visiting the tiger sanctuary and if I could help him out. I made all the arrangements. I also spoke to him in April when I heard he wasn't well. Unfortunately, that turned out to be last interaction," mourned Dixit
