The Oban Times is running a series of articles championing the work carried out by Argyll and Bute Health and Social Care Partnership (HSCP) in the Oban, Lorn and the Isles locality. Each article features a specific service provided by the HSCP and focuses on the staff who provide that service and the role they play in making a positive difference for the people living in Oban and surrounding areas. This week we look at the work of Paula Laidler.
Paula Laidler is a rehabilitation and palliative care nurse at Lorn and Islands Hospital. She initially launched her nursing career in Tameside, where she was based in the accident and emergency department for more than four years. She joined Argyll and Bute Health and Social Care Partnership over seven years ago and has been based in Oban since.
Rehabilitation nurses help patients with long-term physical disabilities or chronic illnesses to deal with their limitations to reach their full potential. The nurses also work closely with patients, their family members and loved ones, and health and social care professionals to create care and recovery plans to assist patients in staying independent for as long as possible.
Rehabilitation is recognised broadly as a four-stage process which includes comprehensive assessment; setting of short-, medium- and long-term goals; development of a plan towards the goals; and evaluation of progress. Within this process, the nursing team input is to implement specific interventions to improve mobility function.
Paula said: 'The general aim is to improve patient's strength and mobility and to find ways around any problems. For example, if somebody has had a fall, equipment may be recommended to assist the patient with walking and an exercise programme could be implemented to improve the patient's strength and balance.'
Palliative care nurses help to improve the quality of life for people, at any stage of serious illnesses. They care for the whole person, combining pain and symptom management with emotional and spiritual support. It is to palliate symptoms, to palliate suffering, whether that suffering is physical, emotional or spiritual. The nursing staff focuses on patients and their family and the best way to navigate patients' illnesses to ensure better outcomes.
Palliative care nurses communicate with many other health and social care professionals daily, from other nurses, specialists, social workers, pharmacists, patients' families and, of course, patients themselves.
Paula continued: 'As a rehabilitation and palliative care nurse, I get the opportunity to build closer relationships with patients and their loved ones.
'My role involves providing person-centred professional care for a wide range of medical conditions and illnesses such as an ongoing life-limiting condition, or patients who are being treated for a sudden illness or injury.
'My responsibilities include a patient's physical and emotional needs as well as helping to support their families and loved ones.'
Paula's day begins with a handover from the previous nursing team shift which can include doctors, pharmacy and various health and social professionals. These meetings are to ensure that patients, some of whom may be receiving end-of-life care, are getting the best quality of care and life as possible. Each shift includes monitoring symptoms, administering different treatments and monitoring side-effects of prescribed medication.
A large part of Paula's job is discussing with patients their symptoms and making them feel comfortable, as well as managing unnecessary pain. It can also include discussing with patients and their families the support that would be needed to self-manage their condition if they were being discharged to their own environment.
This includes working closely with other colleagues such as physiotherapists, occupational therapists and social workers to ensure patients are getting the best possible care needed to support and care for them.
Paula's closely observes patients, including recording information such as vital sign readings, medication and ensuring patients' care plans are followed.
There is also a considerable amount of paperwork to be completed and records that need to be updated regularly. Digital internal technology systems are in place to ensure patient records are updated and are digitally available to other health and social care professionals involved in the patient's care.
Paula added: 'Communication is key to keeping all health and social care professionals informed about a patient's achievements and progress. It also includes taking into account individual patients' needs and preferences.
'Patients have the opportunity to make informed decisions about their care and treatment, in partnership with healthcare professionals. Sharing information helps to ensure patient-centred care and ensures better outcomes for all patients and their loved ones.'
Paula is very athletic and trains hard to participate in challenges and marathons. She is also a member of the local parkrun group. She is well known for running six and half miles to work prior to starting a 12-hour shift and again at the end of her day runs home where she is then greeted by her toddlers, three-year-old Benjiman and one-year-old Harry, who certainly keep her on her toes.
She loves living and working in Oban, and cannot imagine living anywhere else.
Oban has made the dream of living rurally into a reality. The family enjoy wide-open spaces, a variety of beaches and community events and festivals.
Paula said: 'I am really lucky to be surrounded by truly great local people and the community spirit in Oban is amazing. Oban really does have a very strong community spirit where everybody pulls together and people seem to genuinely care about each other.
'It really is a healthy place to raise the boys. There are always lots of activities on for them with pre-school activities always available to keep them active and busy.
'Oban is definitely for our family and we are looking forward to raising our sons here.' Read more about
