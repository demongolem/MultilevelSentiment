"... It's a f--king grind, and sometimes you don't want to do it. You gotta learn to do it when you don't want to do it. That's what pro football is. It hurts. You got to compete against each other. You gotta bust your ass. You gotta be in the right spot, and you gotta play the f--king game the way it's meant to be played. Or you're wasting your time."<br />Stories develop and become the driving narratives behind each training camp. These stories play out on the field as teams ready themselves for the regular season.<br />The following questions still linger, and the answers possibly found during the third preseason contest will have an immediate impact on the 2018 campaign.<br />Philadelphia Eagles at Cleveland Browns<br />1 of 16<br />Philadelphia Eagles quarterbacks Nick Foles (9) and Nate Sudfeld (7)<br />Associated Press<br />8 p.m. ET Thursday at FirstEnergy Stadium, Cleveland (Fox)<br />How much more work will Philadelphia Eagles quarterback<br />get before the regular season?<br />The reigning Super Bowl MVP suffered a<br />when New England Patriots defensive end Adrian Clayborn sacked him during the second preseason contest after Nate Sudfeld and Joe Callahan played the entire first contest.<br />Foles will play Thursday, according to ESPN.com's<br />. His status is critical to the Eagles' early-season plans since Carson Wentz's timetable remains uncertain.<br />"It's gonna be close," Wentz said about playing Week 1, according to The MMQB's<br />.<br />How does the Cleveland Browns offense come together?<br />Josh Gordon is back as part of the Browns organization, but he isn't a full participant yet, per<br />Patrick Maks<br />of the team's site. Jarvis Landry is the team's No. 1 target. Beyond that, nothing in Cleveland's offense has been determined.<br />The passing game flew down the field (11.5 yards per attempt) during the Browns' first preseason contest against the New York Giants.

While some organizations hesitate to place their top performers in preseason contests, Beckham would benefit from playing at least a few snaps, as he hasn't been in a game situation since he broke his ankle in October.<br />Which New York Jets quarterback will emerge as the starter?<br />Sam Darnold appears well on his way to becoming the Jets' starting quarterback. The rookie already got the nod to open the second preseason contest. Whether he does so against the Giants will indicate how far he is along the learning curve.<br />Josh McCown has completed one preseason pass so far. Teddy Bridgewater seems more likely to be trade bait than a starter. Head coach Todd Bowles could lean on either to make sure Darnold isn't rushed, but if the 21-year-old starts a second straight contest, the decision is all but made.<br />Denver Broncos at Washington Redskins<br />3 of 16<br />Washington Redskins running backs Derrius Guice (29) and Samaje Perine (32)<br />Associated Press<br />7:30 p.m. ET Friday at FedEx Field, Landover, Md.<br />Is the Denver Broncos offense ready for prime time?<br />Quarterback Case Keenum believed the Broncos offense "<br />never got into a rhythm" against the Minnesota Vikings in Week 1 of the preseason, per KOA News Radio's<br />. A week later, Keenum said he "<br />finally got into a rhythm" against the Chicago Bears, per 247Sports'<br />Chad Jensen<br />.<br />The Broncos offense showed growth under Keenum's direction, but the group still needs to figure out which runner, Royce Freeman or Devontae Booker, is the lead back.
