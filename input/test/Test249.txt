3D Printing in Healthcare Market Â» Interspinous Process Decompression Devices Market to Reflect Significant Incremental Opportunity During 2018-2026
Interspinous process decompression (IPD) is a minimally invasive procedure that is characterized by spinal stenosis. IPD is an example of advances in the field of minimally invasive spine surgery and is performed as an alternative to decompression spine surgery such as a laminectomy. This procedure is carried out by implanting a device called spacer or interspinous spacer. This implant is inserted between the spinous processes. Spinous processes are the thin, bony projections on the back of the spine, which can be felt when we run our hand over the spine.
