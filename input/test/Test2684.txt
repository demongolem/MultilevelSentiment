2018-10-30 Challenges of Digital Twin in High Value Manufacturing 2018-01-1928 Digital Twin is a dynamic digital representation of a real-world asset, process or system. Industry 4.0 has recognised Digital Twin as the game changers for manufacturing industries in their digital transformation journey. Digital Twin will play a significant role in improving consistency, seamless process development, and the possibility of reuse in subsequent stages across the complete lifecycle of the product. As the concept of Digital Twin is novel, there are several challenges that exist related to its phase of development and implementation, especially in high value manufacturing sector. The paper presents a thematic analysis of current academic literature and industrial knowledge. Based on this, eleven key challenges of digital twin were identified and further discussed. This work is intended to provide an understanding of the current state of knowledge around Digital Twin and formulate the future research directions.
