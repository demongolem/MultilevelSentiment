They revealed their findings at the Black Hat security conference.

LAS VEGASâ€”Twitter bots have been in the news lately. If your follower account dropped recently , it's probably because Twitter swept away millions of fake accounts. Twitter is clearly working to seek and eliminate these bots, but so are security researchers.
Duo Security Principal R&D Engineer Jordan Wright and Data Scientist Olabode Anise took the stage at Black Hat to talk about applying their data science skills to Twitter bot hunting.
"Twitter and other networks exist to share," said Wright. "What makes them great is the ability to have honest conversations. Twitter bots change that, in good and bad ways. Spam-generating bots share the same links over and over. Amplification bots don't generate content, but rather exist to amplify other accounts by liking and retweeting. That's a level of dishonesty. But there are also benign notification bots offering things like news and weather." We Like Big Data and We Cannot Lie
Any kind of data mining requires a big dataset. Twitter offers an application programming interface (API) for gathering data, but with very specific limitations. "We wanted to play by Twitter's API rules. We want reproducible results," said Wright. "So we used a single API key to gather all the data. That's subject to rate limits, so we must be as efficient as possible."
Wright explained that Twitter IDs used to be 32-bit unsigned integers, meaning there could be a total of 4,294,967,296 distinct accounts. One way to get account info is just to guess a number and submit it to the Twitter API. If it's a real account, you get the account name plus metadata including number of tweets, followers, and followed accounts. And you can submit 8.6 billion requests per day. Wright and Anise tried a sampling of 5 percent of the possible IDs and captured a huge number of accounts.
However, Twitter changed the technique for creating unique IDs to a technology called Snowflake . A Snowflake ID is 63 bits of information and can represent an account, a post, a follow, or any other object. The guessing game no longer works. So the team switched to the Streaming API.
"The streaming API gets a stream of random current tweet statuses," said Wright. "It's the full user object, and you can filter on keyword, location, and more. But this introduces bias, as you see only uses who have tweeted recently."
The team went on to enrich the data using other APIs, each with more stringent restrictions. They could request tweet content, limited to 144,000 requests per day. And they could get an account's network of followers and followed, but only 1,400 of those per day. Using these tools strategically, they enriched their data set and started in with machine learning .
The talk then headed off into the weeds of data science. Briefly, they wound up with a model that was pretty good at distinguishing real accounts from bots, but not good enough so support taking action against accounts it identified as bots.

"We gathered the data, and we identified bots," said Jordan. "The final chapter is, how do they connect together and share a common goal? Bots promoting cryptocurrency scams spoof legitimate accounts; how are they linked? We started mapping it out, using each bot account to find others." Relate
