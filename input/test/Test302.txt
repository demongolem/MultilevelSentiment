The Aussie was spotted rubbing a ball with sandpaper to rough up the surface in order to aid swing - before admitting to cheating in March 2018.
Bancroft was also spotted pouring sugar in his pocket during a drinks break with a similar aim.
However, he was hit with a ban three months shorter than captain Steve Smith and his vice David Warner and made his return to competitive action last month.
Now, Durham have opted to bring him in for their next season, with Bancroft himself using it as practice for the 2019 Ashes, to be held in England. AFP Cameron Bancroft was one of three Australians to be banned for ball-tampering AFP Cameron Bancroft was caught using sandpaper to rough up the ball

"With the Ashes and ODI World Cup both being played in the UK in 2019 it will be a huge summer of cricket.
