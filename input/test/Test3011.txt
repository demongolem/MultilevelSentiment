August 16, 2018 - by Kelsey Bibik Freire Advances Through NCAA Woman of the Year Conference Selections
INDIANAPOLIS, Ind. â€“ Florida State graduate and AVCA All-American Vanessa Freire will continue on in the running for the NCAA Woman of the Year Award. This year the Woman of the Year program will see the most ever conference nominees with 153, with 58 Division I nominees.
Because FSU beach volleyball is a member of the Coastal Collegiate Sports Association, associate conference nominees and independent nominees were sent to a separate pool to be considered by a committee. The committee decided on four nominees who do not compete within their school's core conference.
A 2018 All-American, Freire leaves Florida State as one of the most accomplished beach volleyball players the program has ever seen. As a two-year team captain, Freire led the Seminoles to a pair of record-setting seasons, and became one of only six players in program history to reach 100 career overall wins. Freire saw three CCSA Conference Championships and two NCAA National Runner-up finishes in her career.
Freire balanced her athletic career with both schoolwork and community service, acting as the VP of FSU's Student Athlete Advisory Committee (SAAC) for three years and
Freire graduated with a double major in marketing and advertising, and earned a spot on either the Dean's List, the ACC Honor Roll or the CCSA Honor Roll every one of her four years.
The NCAA Woman of the Year award, established in 1991, honors graduating female college athletes who have exhausted their eligibility and distinguished themselves in academics, athletics, service and leadership throughout their collegiate careers.
The nominees competed in 20 different women's sports across all three NCAA divisions, including 251 from Division I, 131 from Division II and 199 from Division III. A program-record 170 were multisport athletes in college.
The NCAA Committee on Women's Athletics manages the nomination process and selections. In 2017, a record-number 543 female college athletes representing multiple ethnicities and all NCAA-sponsored sports within Divisions I, II and III, were nominated.
The top 30 honorees will be celebrated and the 2018 NCAA Woman of the Year will be announced at the annual award ceremony Oct. 28 in Indianapolis.
