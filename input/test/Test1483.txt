Sergio Aguero scored three of Manchester City's six goals against Huddersfield<br />Trying to predict what might happen during a Premier League weekend was never likely to end well.<br />Last week, we crunched the numbers and came up with a<br />series of pointers<br />for selecting your fantasy football team. We suggested it could be a rare weekend to avoid Manchester City's attackers (they scored six), we said Watford never concede away (they scored on the road for the first time since January) and we pointed out that Harry Kane never scores in August (he scored in August).<br />On the plus side, we did say you might want to stick James Milner in your team and he proved us right by scoring against Crystal Palace.<br />So we're not claiming we know what's going to happen in the top flight this weekend, but we've looked into the stats to give you a few pointers on which teams - and players - you might expect to perform well.<br />Put your money on Sterling...<br />Raheem Sterling was left out of the Manchester City side last weekend despite scoring against Arsenal in their opening fixture<br />Manchester City manager Pep Guardiola picked an unusual line-up against Huddersfield last weekend, leaving Raheem Sterling, Leroy Sane, and Kyle Walker on the bench.<br />"Pep has taken out all the guys with pace and got his footballers on," said former Everton midfielder Leon Osman. "He's gone for guys with quick feet who can operate in small spaces."<br />Against a Huddersfield side penned back into their own half and intent mainly on containing, the tactic worked a treat, with David Silva starring and Sergio Aguero scoring a hat-trick.<br />Premier League top goalscorers 2018-19<br />3<br />Sergio Aguero (Man City), Sadio Mane (Liverpool), Richarlison (Everton)<br />2<br />Pedro (Chelsea), Roberto Pereyra (Watford), Paul Pogba (Man Utd), Callum Wilson (Bournemouth)<br />City's attacking riches mean it is almost impossible to predict who Guardiola might pick against Wolves on Saturday, but he does tend to look to Sterling when his side play away from home.<br />The England forward has been involved in seven of City's past 18 goals on the road - three goals and four assists in seven games - more than any other player in that period.<br />Wolves played fluent attacking football under Nuno Espirito Santo in the Championship and will want to continue that against the champions.<br />That desire to attack - which will inevitably leave spaces to exploit - could make Sterling an attractive pick for Guardiola.<br />Expect goals in Bournemouth v Everton<br />Bournemouth have won two games out of two to start the season<br />At the risk of guaranteeing this game ends 0-0, there are always goals when Bournemouth play Everton. Literally.<br />The sides have met 10 times, with seven of those games in the Premier League era, and there has never been a 0-0 draw.<br />In fact, the past six meetings have produced 25 goals (11 for Bournemouth, 14 for Everton) at an average of more than four per game.<br />But which players to pick in your team? Bournemouth are in fine form, having won four consecutive Premier League matches for the first time dating back to last season, and striker Callum Wilson has been instrumental in that run, scoring in three straight top-flight games for the first time.<br />For Everton, &pound;50m summer signing Richarlison is the man of the moment. He has scored three times in two games and he does love August - 50% (four out of eight) of his Premier League goals have come in that month.<br />Bournemouth v Everton - past six meetings<br />Date<br /
