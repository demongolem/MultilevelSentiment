Jordan B Peterson On Meaningful Engagement First, you might presume that you don't know what the good life might be for you. You can guess, of course, and you can apply some practical generalizations (you need an intimate relationship, a meaningful career or occupation, reasonable health, and so on), but it is more productive to assume ignorance, initially. Then, watch yourself for two weeksâ€Šâ€”â€Šas if (1) you don't know who you are and (2) you are someone you are charged with caring for. Then notice , day to day, when you are engaged in an activity that is meaningful. During such a state, you will not be self-conscious, and you will not be aware of the passage of time. Also notice when you are engaged in an activity that makes you ashamed, or weakens you. This will often happen when you are saying or doing something that is false, to live up to some idea you have of yourself, or want other people to have of you. Then, after the two week period, start doing more of the former, and less of the latter. It is also very helpful, when starting this process, to be very careful to tell the truth because, if you don't, you will cloud your vision and it will be impossible for you to determine what is good for you and what is not. You may well be surprised by what you find out about yourself. Jordan B Peterson On Cultivating Oneself Organising Thoughts To write well, you need first to know what you are talking about. Thus, you have to do your research. To do that, you have to know how to read, what to read, and where to find it. Then you have to be able to generate information, so that your writing is creative, and edit it, so that you separate the wheat from the chaff. Then you have to be able to organize your argument, at the level of the word, the sentence, the paragraph and the essay itself. If you can do that, you can organize your thoughts and, in consequence, your brain. Then you can help organize other brains, and other structures. Maximum Time And Optimal Way To Study Don't study more than 7.5 hours a day. You will just wear yourself out. More won't help. You can't learn when you are exhausted. Take a day off per week. Do something you like on that day. You are in this for the long haul, so you can't wear yourself out. That would be counter-productive. Your job is to learn, not to prematurely die trying. Make a plan. What knowledge is most critical in each of the subjects? First, concentrate only on that. Imagine that you are first planning to obtain the easiest 50% in each study area. Study from low to high resolution. Familiarize yourself with the central ideas of the study areas. Then, and only then, concentrate on the details. This means that you have to broadly outline the study domain, as if you were summarizing it in essay format. I have produced a guide to such an outlining process here: http://jordanbpeterson.com/Psy43â€¦ Nap. A lot. Study for 2.5 hours. Take a break. Eat something. Do something mindless, like watching a Simpson's episode. Then have a nap. That will refresh you, and also increase the probability that you will remember what you have studied. Sleeping helps consolidate memory. Study one topic for 2.5 hours. Then switch to another. Continue. Read. Then put down the book. Then summarize what you have read. Don't look at what you were reading when you summarize. You have to practice recall, not repeatedly expose yourself to the same material. You are practicing remembering. That's what makes you good at remembering. Going over the material ad nauseum won't work. It just feels like work, without any of the actual difficulty of work (or the benefits). Don't highlight or underline or anything useless and self-deceptive like that. Powernaps The most straightforward way to increase your energy at the end of the day is to have a brief napâ€Šâ€”â€Š20 to 45 minutes, sometimes longer. This will add 3â€“4 hours of productive time to your evening. Jordan B Peterson On Opening Fire 1. There is no sense making unnecessary enemies. Life is hard and time is short enough to justify adroitly side-stepping ideological arguments and counter-arguments whenever you can. So, if you can shut up, it is often best to do so. 2. It is useful to stop talking if the person you are speaking to is not listening. When that happens the two of you are not in the same place and communication is not possible. When you continue speaking under such circumstances you are generally trying to push fate in a direction it is not currently willing to go.

What Law Is For If you are wronged, then you may feel a moral obligation to seek revenge. Imagine, for example, that your daughter or wife is raped. A functioning criminal justice system will help relieve you of that obligation (partly by acting on your account; partly by forbidding you to take revenge). By doing so, it will help ensure that every wrong, accidental or purposeful, does not launch an escalating war of retribution. Jordan B Peterson On IQ And EQ IQ is the most well-validated concept in the social sciences, bar none. It is an excellent predictor of academic performance, creativity, ability to abstract, processing speed, learning ability and general life success. There are other traits that are important to general success, including conscientiousness, which is an excellent predictor of grades, managerial and administrative ability, and life outcomes, on the more conservative side. It should also be noted that IQ is five or more times as powerful a predictor as even good personality trait predictors such as conscientiousness. The true relationship between grades, for example, and IQ might be as high as r = .50 or even .60 (accounting for 25â€“36% of the variance in grades). Conscientiousness, however, probably tops out at around r = .30, and is more typically reported as r = .25 (say, 5 to 9% of the variance in grades). There is nothing that will provide you with a bigger advantage in life than a high IQ. Nothing. To repeat it: NOTHING. This is why academic psychologists almost never measure it. If you measure it along with your putatively â€žnew" measure, IQ will kill your ambitions. For the career minded, this is a no go zone. So people prefer to talk about multiple intelligences and EQ, and all these things that do not exist. PERIOD. There is no such thing as EQ. Let me repeat that: â€žThere is NO SUCH THING AS EQ." The idea was popularized by a journalist, Daniel Goleman, not a psychologist. You can't just invent a trait. You have to define it and measure it and distinguish it from other traits and use it to predict the important ways that people vary. Hell and Heaven Hell is the worst corner of the underworld. The underworld is where you go when something tragic and unexpected happens in your life, and shatters your dreams. It is the place of confusion and disillusionment. Everyone has been to the underworldâ€Šâ€”â€Šand some do not come back. Hell is the corner you end up in when you are so confused and disillusioned that you become arrogant, resentfulâ€Šâ€”â€Šand then cruel and vengeful. To be in hell is to wish for the eradication of existence, for the sake of revenge. The Kingdom of Heaven is spread out upon the earth, but men do not see it. What does this mean? Heaven and hell exist now. We move between them, constantly. Some people are in hell. You can see them, if you pay attention, when you are walking down any major street in any city. Most people are in heaven, some of the timeâ€Šâ€”â€Šbut they are not fully conscious of it, because they don't know to think that way (and they don't know that they should strive above all to stay there). From my perspective, both heaven and hell are real places, and people journey through each, occasionallyâ€Šâ€”â€Šsometimes even during the same day. But people don't really notice. A conscious person has noticed hell, and strives to avoid being there. A malevolent person works assiduously to increase the domain of hell. A good person improves the quality of experience whenever that is possible, for himself and others, and aims at that consciously. Pay Attention and Speak True -I
