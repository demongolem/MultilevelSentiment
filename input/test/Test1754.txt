is a brilliant thing. It's fast and it's comfortable and everything in between. But, if it has one flaw, it's that it's perhaps a little<br />too<br />Acura<br />is turning up the heat.<br />We'll start with the most visual aspect of that stale cliche, for which I can only apologize. In 2019, the NSX picks up a new color in its palette: Thermal Orange Pearl. Meant to harken back to Acura's motorsport heritage, fans of RealTime Racing will likely want to pony up the extra $700 for that hue.<br />The car also sees a few other visual tweaks, like the front grille garnish now painted rather than the former chrome. Orange calipers are an option on the carbon-ceramic brakes, too.<br />2019 Acura NSX in its tangy, new hue<br />The interior receives a few tweaks as well. Those who go for the four-way power seats can now have them trimmed in red instead of just black, meaning my dream of a white NSX with red interior is now a practical reality. Those power seats are now standard fare, too, though the lighter, manual seats can still be had if you prefer -- but only in black.<br />Other former interior options like Acura's higher-end ELS Studio audio system and the connected navigation system are now standard, plus proximity parking sensors and even the fancy aluminum sport pedals.<br />The bigger changes, though, won't be so easy to spot. They start with a new standard tire, Continental SportContact 6, which is said to offer far better grip than its previous generation. With greater grip comes greater responsibility, so the anti-rollbars and bushings have been stiffened. Finally the dampers, transmission and SH-AWD system have all had a software refresh.<br />Time to live out those RealTime Racing fantasies.<br />Acura<br />The result? Acura says the NSX is now a full two seconds faster than the previous model around the epic Suzuka Grand Prix circuit, a track that rewards both handling and power. More importantly, Acura says the car is now more "playful" at the limit, a description I can't wait to verify.<br />The 2019 Acura NSX starts at $157,000. That's $1,500 higher than last year, but remember, you get the seats and speakers and all that good stuff as standard fare, options that would have previously cost you $4,700. Just don't forget to budget an extra $700 for orange.<br />Latest Reviews: Performance Cars<br /
