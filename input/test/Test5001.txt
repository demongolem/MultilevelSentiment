The Vice President has called for donors' support to finance the peace agreement to enable its speedy implementation.
Dr. James Wani Igga made the appeal yesterday while making remarks during a conference on International Cooperation and Sustainable Peace at the AU headquarters in Ethiopia's capital, Addis Ababa.
He told the African leaders that South Sudan is now embarking on implementation of the Khartoum peace deal.
But he says the country is lacking financial support.
"As we are now embarking on serious implementation, we cannot be so successful without being supported by the international community, particularly from all the peace lovers," Igga told the participants.
The conference was attended by many African leaders, including the former president of Burundi and the Ugandan parliamentary speaker.
It was organized by Heavenly Culture, World Peace, and Restoration of Light organization.
