SVJ smashed the lap record at the NÃ¼rburgring and now it can smash all your hopes of ever owning or driving it, because the company is building less than a thousand of them!<br />The Aventador SVJ features all the hotness you heard about, including the new, updated version of<br />Lamborghini<br />'s brilliant ALA system and maybe most importantly a 770 horsepower naturally aspirated V12. Unlike the big, dumb V12 Lamborghinis of old, the SVJ is both all-wheel drive and features four-wheel steering. Yeah, we're more than a little curious what that would feel like too.<br />The Lamborghini Aventador SVJ is the most extreme Lamborghini yet produced.<br />Lamborghini<br />This super-spicy meatball will do the sprint to 60 miles per hour in just 2.8 seconds, or fast enough to give you a nosebleed, probably and it very likely sounds like someone harnessed a pack of pilled-up demons to the Doof warrior's rig.<br />In addition to the 900 plain ol' garden variety SVJ models, Lamborghini is also building 63 special edition cars called, appropriately enough, the Lamborghini Aventador SVJ 63. This car is even more special and carbon fiber-y and it's debuting on Sunday at Pebble Beach.<br />The interior of the SVJ is all business but Lamborghini will let buyers customize to their hearts content, for a fee.<br />Lamborghini<br />Lamborghini is extra especially proud of the trick aerodynamics package that it's using on the SVJ, claming that it's good for an increase of over 40 percent more downforce over each axle and a 1 percent improvement in drag over the previous Aventador SV.<br />The first customers who plunk down Lamborghini's asking price of $517,770 can expect to take delivery of probably the greatest Lamborghini ever built early next year.<br /
