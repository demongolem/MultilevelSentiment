The global surgical instrument tracking systems market is expected to reach a value of USD 442.9 million by 2025, according to a new report by Grand View Research, Inc. Increasing incidence of surgical instruments being left behind after surgery is the most significant factor anticipated to boost the market growth during the forecast period. Annually in the U.S, around 4,500 to 6,000 surgical instruments are left in the surgical sites, which results in the need of additional surgery for removal of retained devices from the body. This in turn results in the need for operating instrument tracking products. Rising adoption of medical devices and instrument tracking products by private and public hospitals is another major factor contributing to the growth of the market. The inventory management and tracing of medical devices and instruments during work cycle, such as during sterilization procedures, surgery, and post-surgery, is a major problem faced by the hospitals. Thus, the need of medical devices and instrument tracking systems is growing at high rate, which is expected to propel the growth of the sector.
