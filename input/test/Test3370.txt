Smart Home
With the ultra-affordable Google Home Mini and Echo Dot often on sale for as little as $30, it's no surprise that sales of smart speakers have gone through the roof over the past 12 months. The global market saw year-on-year growth of 187% in Q2, with total shipments increasing from 5.8 million in 2017 to a staggering 16.8 million for the same period in 2018. Google's lead from Q1 has been retained â€” it sold 5.4 million Home devices in the second quarter.
This time last year, Amazon held a healthy lead in the space with 82.3% of sales against Google's 16.9%. While Echo devices now only make up 24.5% (4.1 million) of the market, Google has doubled its share (32.3%). According to the report from data firm Canalys , both companies rely heavily on increasing US demand for smart speakers, but improving availability in Europe and Asia has also been an important factor.
China was responsible for 52% of the total growth, with Alibaba and Xiaomi now third and fourth in overall shipments, respectively. They account for 90% of the market in a country where sales of smart speakers were almost non-existent a year ago. We can expect to see China overtake the US in total marketshare in the near future â€” another good reason for Google's renewed focus on rolling out its services in the region . Source
