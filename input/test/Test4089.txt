President Trump could revoke the security clearances of more former Obama-era administration officials and critics 'soon,' despite criticism of his action against former CIA Director John Brennan, according to a report Trump's daughter-in-law, Lara Trump, has blasted a new secret recording released by Omarosa that appears to show her offering the former reality star a job on Trump's re-election campaign; Omarosa reportedly could have hundreds of more secret recordings, sparking concern among White House officials Jurors in the fraud trial of Paul Manafort ended the first day of deliberations Thursday without a verdict but had a series of questions for the judge -- which encouraged lawyers for the ex-Trump campaign manager Colorado authorities believe they may have found the bodies of two missing girls allegedly killed, along with their pregnant mother, by their father in the family's residence THE LEAD STORY - WHOSE SECURITY CLEARANCE WILL BE REVOKED NEXT? - President Trump could act soon against several other top Obama-era intelligence and law enforcement officials whose security clearance credentials are under review, the Washington Post reports ... On Wednesday, Trump revoked the security clearance for former CIA Director John Brennan , and suggested in an interview that he based his decision on Brennan's role in starting the Russia collusion investigation . The White House is looking into the clearances of several other former officials and Trump critics, including: former FBI director James Comey; former deputy FBI director Andrew McCabe; former director of national intelligence James Clapper; former national security adviser Susan Rice; former CIA director Michael Hayden (who also worked under President George W. Bush); Justice Department official Bruce Ohr; recently fired FBI agent Peter Strzok and former FBI general counsel Lisa Page.
Two White House officials who spoke on the condition of anonymity to the Washington Post said Trump is eager to act on the security clearances review list and believes he has emerged looking strong in his public feud with Brennan. Meanwhile, group of 12 former CIA directors, including retired Army Gen. David H. Petraeus , and a former director of National Intelligence showed support for Brennan late Thursday and issued a joint statement calling Trump's move "an attempt to stifle free speech."
Trump's revocation of Brennan's security clearance leaves lawyers asking if former CIA chief can appeal Gregg Jarrett: Ex-CIA Director Brennan shouldn't have a security clearance - He's a national security risk Tucker: 'Fake war hero' Blumenthal, others claim Trump 'illegally' violated Brennan's rights Retired U.S. commander stands with Brennan : 'Revoke my clearance' too A list of Obama officials who could lose security clearances under Trump DEEPER OMAROSA 'BETRAYAL'? Lara Trump tore into her old friend Omarosa Manigault Newman, accusing her of betrayal Thursday after she released a tape of the president's daughter-in-law apparently offering her a job on the 2020 campaign shortly after being fired from the White House ... Lara, who is married to Eric Trump, fired back after Manigault Newman appeared on MSNBC and aired excerpts from a tape that appeared to show her offering her a job at $180,000 a year to join Trump's re-election campaign.
On the tape, Lara Trump appears to make reference to a New York Times story that reported Manigault Newman was preparing to tell her story, and tells her that could not happen if she joined the campaign. Manigault Newman told MSNBC she saw it as an attempt to "buy my silence, to censor me" and claimed it is more proof that what she details in her new book is accurate.
And there could be more secret tapes to come. The New York Times reported that Manigault Newman could have as many as 200 tapes from her time in the Trump administration, leaving White House aides concerned.
Omarosa book raises questions on what the top-paid White House official actually did Sean Spicer: Omarosa claim of hush money 'categorically false' 'WE'RE IN THE GAME': Defense lawyers for former Trump campaign manager Paul Manafort believe they have a reason to be optimistic as jurors enter their second day of deliberations on Friday ... The jury ended the first day of deliberations Thursday without a verdict, but did ask the judge a series of questions before breaking -- a development the defense took as good news ...One source close to the Manafort team told FOX News, "We're in the game." Before court was adjourned in the afternoon, U.S. District Judge T.S. Ellis III announced that jurors would continue their work on Friday morning. Ellis read aloud a note detailing four questions from the jury, which covered foreign financial accounts, shell companies, the definition of reasonable doubt and other evidence in the case.
How Paul Manafort is connected to Trump, Russia investigation GRIM DISCOVERY: Colorado authorities announced they found "two bodies" that are thought to be the two young girls reported missing along with their pregnant mother, who was found dead earlier Thursday, officials said ... Officials in Frederick tweeted that "police have strong reason to believe" that the bodies are Celeste Watts, 3, and Bella Watts, 4. The girls' father, Chris Watts, is accused of killing them and their mother, Shanann Watts, and is thought to have committed the alleged murders at the family's residence, prosecutors said Thursday.
Chris Watts, 33, was ordered to be held without bond by Judge Marcelo Copcow during a court appearance following his arrest. He is expected to be charged with three counts each of murder and tampering with evidence. The judge gave prosecutors a Monday deadline to charge him formally.
