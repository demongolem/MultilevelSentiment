Why You Should Start Thinking About Buying British Hannah Goode People should be encouraged to buy British
How aware are you of where your stuff is made? Do you care?
No? Well you probably should.
Take a closer look at your favourite item of clothing or a few of your favourite gadgets and find out where they were made. I recently did this and found that nothing I checked was made in Britain. My headphones were made in China, my sunglasses were made in Cambodia and my t-shirt and shorts were made in India (and this company is a 'proud' British company!). In actual fact, I'm not sure I own anything that was made in Britain.
If you do the same exercise, chances are you'll find a similar thing.
It probably comes as no great surprise. We know companies are always looking to reduce production costs and there are huge savings to be made on labour and materials by shifting production to areas with low wages.
So what does it matter? Surely cheaper production costs mean cheaper end products so everyones a winner?
Unfortunately, everyone is not a winner.
Here are three very good reasons to explore British manufactured products the next time you go shopping.
1) Working conditions.
Whilst labour is much cheaper in places like China and India, the working conditions in some factories are very poor. Workers are asked to commit to painfully long shifts in sub-par conditions and get paid very little for their efforts. Workers are encouraged to sleep on the job.
In fact the shifts are so long that management actively encourages sleeping on the job.
People work to extremely tight targets and deadlines and they know if they don't perform, there are hundreds of people willing to take their place.
It has to be said that conditions have improved and are improving all of the time but there are still many areas where labour is being exploited.
2) Preserving a skilled workforce Skilled workforce
The UK is home to some of the finest craftsmanship in the world but if there skills keep getting overlooked in favour of cheaper alternatives, these skills will slowly fade and they won't get passed on.
Industries such as textiles also contribute greatly to the UK economy so the less we produce, the bigger the impact on GDP.
British furniture maker Katie Walker offers a collection of British made furniture skilfully designed and made in the UK. By looking to manufactures like this, we support our home grown talent enabling growth.
3) Sustainability
This might be obvious to some and less obvious to others but there are a number of environment and sustainability issues with buying imported goods.
A t-shirt made in India (for example) has to be shipped across the the UK, transported to a warehouse to be sorted and then transported to the shop. The environmental cost of importing these goods is very high compared to a product manufactured in Britain.
Firewood is often sourced from unsustainable European woodland and imported for sale in Britain. Not only have we got the environmental cost of the shipping but also the destruction of precious woodland. Imported firewood also risks spreading disease.
There is no need to buy firewood from suppliers who are importing wood from unsustainable woodland. With a little research you can find companies selling firewood sourced in the UK and make a difference.
Here is a company offering dried by kiln firewood, locally sourced from sustainable woodland: https://www.certainlywood.co.uk/
Do you care?
Ultimately, it comes down to how much you care about buying British and the environmental, economical and social benefits it has. It would be a little unrealistic for everyone to buy only British products but that's not necessary. It's enough to just get more informed about where your products are coming from so you can make good decisions about whether to buy them. Edi
