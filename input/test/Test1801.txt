Rob Havenstein<br />is dealing with an ankle issue that could keep him out, too.<br />While Gurley definitely won't play, the door is slightly ajar for Goff if Havenstein manages to line up. Still, McVay didn't seem too confident about the<br />Rams<br />faithful getting their first glimpse of Goff this week. Nor does he feel Goff needs to play at some point this preseason to avoid looking rusty for Week 1.<br />&quot;The way that we would operate if he does play is not going to be anything close to the way that we'll operate in a normal game,&quot; McVay said. &quot;... We're not game planning, we're not doing things that are consistent with our normal approach.&quot;<br />Gurley isn't brokenhearted over being on sideline duty until September.<br />&quot;That is everyone's dream not to play in the preseason,&quot;<br />Gurley said<br />.<br />The development means we might have to wait until Week 1 to see Gurley and Goff together on the field. It's pretty unusual for a team not to play some of their starters for at least a series or two during the preseason -- especially in Week 3, which is considered the holy of holies in the sanctum of the preseason calendar.<br />Perhaps McVay will buck tradition again in seven days and play Goff in the final preseason game -- a match usually dedicated for evaluating roster bubble players -- but don't count on it.<br /
