'What I said falls below the standards expected of the captain of Motherwell Football Club.<br />'I do not condone violent behaviour or wish to trivialise an injury suffered by a fellow professional.<br />'I got caught up in the excitement of preparing for a big game and said something I regret. We will be competitive on Sunday, but we will always try to play within the rules.' However, Hartley also claimed that he will attempt to provoke Rangers striker Alfredo Morelos into picking up a red card, having watched that tactic succeed earlier this season at Pittodrie.<br />Fabio Cardoso suffered a broken nose when Ryan Bowman's arm caught him in the face<br />'It was a good game against Morelos (in the semi-final) at Hampden,' he said. 'He's a very good striker and it was a battle - he hit me and I hit him early.' Asked whether it was easy to provoke the Colombian, Hartley replied: 'I think you've seen recently that it is. He can be wound up, as Aberdeen's Scott McKenna proved. He got inside his head and got him sent off.<br />'Morelos has a short fuse but most top strikers have that. Look at Diego Costa - I'm not comparing Morelos to him but he's a similar type of personality.<br />'That can sometimes benefit those players but, equally, it can often mean that their teams end up playing with ten men.' Prior to last weekend's meeting at Rugby Park, Kilmarnock's former Rangers striker Kris Boyd claimed defenders would not be doing their jobs properly if they didn't attempt to needle Morelos - or any other striker with a quick temper - and Hartley concurs.<br />'Of course, because it gives them something else to think about,' he claimed.<br />'He's trying to concentrate on how he's been told to play but if you're getting into his head then it scrambles him a bit.<br />Hartley riled Ibrox fans by claiming that he enjoyed watching Cardoso suffer<br />'That gives defenders an edge and I don't mind a wind-up. A spade's a spade as far as I'm concerned, so I'm not going to sugar-coat anything.<br />'I fully intend to go out and win this game. We're not looking to settle for a point.' Hartley could come up against Rangers' new signing Kyle Lafferty for the first time this weekend and he can't wait to face the Northern Ireland star.<br />'I've never played against him,' he said. 'I was injured when he was at Hearts - I came here just after we'd beaten them 2-1 and I missed the other games against them.<br />'But he's a quality player and, without a doubt, that's what you're going to get when you play Rangers because they have a lot of people in that category.<br />'I had a few good battles with Morelos last season and Lafferty adds to the mix for them, a different type of player who's good in the air and good on the floor.<br />'We've shown Rangers a lot of respect on the training ground this week but that will go out the window on Sunday because we plan to win this game. I'm a physical guy and I like those kinds of battles but I also like to test myself mentally against these teams, to find out how good I am, what I need to improve on and what level I can get to.<br />'Lafferty's an international player and, if I can do a job against him, I'll be delighted. I'm looking forward to the challenge.' The new-look Rangers rearguard assembled by Gerrard has already won plaudits but Hartley warned Connor Goldson and Nikola Katic that they will be roughed up.<br />'If it's Conor Sammon and Danny Johnson (who start), then I don't think Rangers' new centre-halves are going to know what's hit them,' he claimed.<br />'They'll get a shock when they see the size of our centre-forwards and if, for example, Sammo starts the game, then the gaffer can take him off after 60 minutes and send on Curtis Main and they'll think: "Oh no - another bruiser coming on!".'<br />RELATED ARTICLES<br /
