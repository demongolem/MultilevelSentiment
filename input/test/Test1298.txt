, "a spokesman for Mueller said there was no dispute when Mueller, who was FBI director at the time, left the club."<br />22. "I have great respect for what he's done in terms of what he's going through."<br />This is Trump's response to an Earhardt question on whether he is considering pardoning former campaign chairman Paul Manafort. Trump's response is a little bit different -- OK, a LOT bit different -- from how White House Secretary Sarah Sanders answered the Manafort pardon question on Wednesday afternoon. "Once again, that is not something that has been up for discussion," Sanders said. Um, what?<br />23. "He wasn't with the campaign long."<br />Manafort was Trump's de facto campaign manager from April 2016 until August 2016. That period was of critical import to Trump as he went from the frontrunner for the nomination to securing it. It was also the period of time -- June 2016 to be exact -- that we know Manafort as well as Donald Trump Jr. and Jared Kushner<br />to talk about the alleged dirt they claimed to have on Hillary Clinton.<br />24. "They surveilled my campaign, it's very simple."<br />The FBI surveilled Carter Page, a foreign policy aide to Trump,<br />because they believed him to be possibility under the influence of the Russians<br />. The surveillance warrant was approved by the FISA court and re-approved three times. This wasn't some rogue operation conducted by the so-called "deep state" within the FBI.<br />25. "When everybody see's what going on in the Justice Department  I always put justice now with quotes. It's a very, very sad day.  Jeff Sessions recused himself, which he shouldn't have done. Or he should have told me."<br />This is Trump's response to Earhardt asking whether he was going to fire Sessions. It doesn't exactly read like a vote of confidence.<br />26. "Even my enemies say that Jeff Sessions should have told you that he was going to recuse himself and then you wouldn't have put him in."<br />[Narrator voice: They don't.]<br />27. "You know the only reason I gave him the job. Because I felt loyalty, he was an original supporter. He was on the campaign."<br />A remarkable admission here from Trump -- albeit unintentional. The "only reason" he appointed Jeff Sessions to be the nation's highest ranking law enforcement official was because Sessions was loyal to him on the campaign.<br />28. "The immigration laws are horrible. We're doing an incredible job."<br />Back to back sentences. Unedited. No rhyme, reason or connection I can decipher.<br />29. "You know when you have bad laws you can do good. But you can do a lot better if you had good laws."<br />[scratches out a series of complex math equations on a yellow-lined notebook]<br />Yeah, this checks out.<br />30. "I don't know how you can impeach somebody who's done a great job."<br />This is the most astounding quote in the entire Trump interview.  If you are doing a self-assessed "great job" then it is impossible for you to have broken any laws? That's<br />literally<br />what Trump is saying here.<br />31. "I tell you what, if I ever got impeached, I think the market would crash, I think everybody would be very poor."<br />Remarkable. The self-regard on display here is truly staggering. The only thing that has made the economy strengthen is Trump, according to Trump. Without him? Good luck, America.<br />32. "The New York Times cannot write a good story about me. They're crazed. They're like lunatics."<br />Let's be clear here. Trump views "true" news as news that is good for him. "Fake news" is then news that is bad for him. For all of his talk about "fake news" he is totally uninterested in the accuracy of reporting. He is entirely fixated on whether a story reads positively or negatively for him.<br />33. "And I'll never forget, you talk about the fake news, they said Donald Trump met [Kim Jong Un] the first day it was incredible, nobody could believe I was able to do it."<br />So, wait. The news is fake. But Trump cites favorably in this section the fact that the news reported on the historic summit he engineered with North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un. But if the news is fake, then how...<br />[head explodes]<br />34. "So I give myself an A-plus."<br />Earhardt asked Trump what grade he would give himself. That Trump went with the highest possible grade really tells you everything you need to know about him. Seriously.<br />35. "The only thing ... I'm doing badly on is the press doesn't cover me fairly."<br />If I had to name my greatest weakness, I think I would probably say it's that I care too much about people. Or maybe that I am so smart it makes it hard to interact with people not as smart as me. Either one would work.<br />36. "I would say I would honestly give myself an A-plus and so would many other people."<br />So many other people.<br /
