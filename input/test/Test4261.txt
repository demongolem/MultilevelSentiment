The "Global Cancer Immunotherapies Market to 2024 - Increased Uptake of Immune Checkpoint Inhibitors Driving Growth, Supported by a Large, Robust Pipeline" report has been added to ResearchAndMarkets.com's offering.
The report focuses on the key indications of breast cancer, leukemia, lymphoma, melanoma and non-small cell lung cancer, these indications are the largest in terms of size, with 448, 526, 456, 415 and 374 in active development, respectively. The pipeline is dominated mAbs, cell therapies, small molecules and cancer vaccines.
Cancer immunotherapy, which can predominantly be classed as a form of targeted therapy, drives an immune response against cancer cells. This may include stimulating a patient's immune system in a general way or aiding the identification of specific antigens associated with the cancer.
The interest in cancer immunotherapy development has been driven by the growing understanding of the immune system as a hallmark of cancer pathophysiology, particularly immune evasion of developing cancer cells. Overall, 3,863 products are being actively developed in the cancer immunotherapy pipeline, approximately half of the overall oncology pipeline.
