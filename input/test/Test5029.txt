The agreement between LaLiga and multinational, sports and entertainment group, Relevent, is a "15-year, equal joint venture to promote soccer in the US and Canada. As part of the agreement, LaLiga plans to bring a regular season club match to the United States, the first to be played outside of Europe," explained LaLiga in a press communique.
The communique adds that the organization "will work to cultivate soccer culture in the US and Canada using the unequalled assets of LaLiga," saying "North America will be exposed to the unparalleled Spanish soccer culture, renowned for its passion, drama, history, flair and creativity."
There will also be "related activities including youth academies, development of youth soccer coaches, marketing agreements, consumer activations and exhibition matches."
