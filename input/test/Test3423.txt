Genesis Group Strategic Upgrade Press Conference & 1st Blockcloud Appreciation Conference in China was held in Four Seasons Hotel Beijing on August 16, 2018, gathering cooperation agencies, media and big shots in this industry.
Genesis Group, the leading investment agency in the field of Blockchain, has fulfilled the comprehensive upgrade from single investment to digital fund, deep incubation as well as Investment Banks. "In this depressed market, money investment alone is bound to be knocked out. Investment agencies need to provide mother-like support including operating mode, service and resources," Feng Chi, CEO of Genesis Group, interpreted this upgrade at this conference.
As Genesis Group's first deep incubation project, Blockcloud has a world-class team composed of scientists from top research institutes such as Princeton, Tsinghua University and Tokyo University and partners such as Morgan Stanley, BAT and Huawei. This advantage in research will help the team optimize TCP/IP for the current network. Yet how to get through from lab to market and present the project value? These are problems Genesis Group and Blockcloud shall face together. Fortunately, with strengths in their respective fields and their joint efforts, Blockcloud was highly recognized worldwide and is ranked top 5 on the global project assessment list. As its CEO Ming Zhongxing introduced at this Appreciation Conference, Blockcloud has completed its private equity fund and it is much better than expected.
At the end of this conference, Genesis Group expressed its determination to give more support to Blockcloud in the field of economy system, strategic plan, talent pool, community system and marketing, and thus ensuring the continuous growth of the Blockcloud.
