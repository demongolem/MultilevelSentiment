Herbert Smith Freehills' market-leading renewables practice has continued its run as the country's leading project finance legal advisor in the sector, topping all three project finance league tables for renewables deals.
In the first half of 2018, Herbert Smith Freehills was ranked: 1 st by value and deal count â€“ Australia (Inframation Deals) 1 st by value and deal count â€“ Australia (IJGlobal) 1 st by value and deal count â€“ Australia (Dealogic)
The Inframation Deals results show that Herbert Smith Freehills advised on eight completed wind and solar transactions with a combined value of almost A$2.5 billion, well ahead of its nearest competitor.
Herbert Smith Freehills partner Gerard Pike explained that Australia saw its biggest year ever for new renewable energy projects in 2017 and 2018 is even busier. Despite a difficult regulatory environment, renewable developers are driving ahead as a consequence of lower technology costs, liquid debt and capital markets, corporate offtakers and the realisation of Australia's world class solar and wind resources.
"The results reflect the strong partnerships the firm continues to hold with its long-standing clients in the renewables sector and HSF's ability to offer top quality legal services covering all aspects of renewable project development and financing, he said.
"As the regulatory, offtake and grid connection requirements for projects become more complicated there is real value in obtaining top quality advice to ensure projects are not delayed in grid connection, project financing or procurement."
Toby Anderson , the firm's Regional Head of Projects for Asia/Pacific commented, "We are very proud to have worked closely with a number of participants in the Australian renewables sector. Our rankings are reflective of a lot of hard work over the last 12 months by our specialist renewables team."
