2018-10-30 Instrument Data Distribution System (iDDS): Optimised Data Transfer in Real-Time Data Acquisition Test Systems 2018-01-1950 Data Transfer techniques have evolved steadily over the last few decades with both open and vendor proprietary methods used and widely deployed. This has led to large test systems with many different physical and logical technologies to solve the same problem, and an associated high integration cost. With the latest devices and systems converging towards wired and wireless Ethernet standards, the physical problem has tentatively been solved - but what of the logical issue? There are hundreds of different standards for Ethernet based communication out there, especially with the proliferation of "Internet of Things" devices and technologies, and this once again breeds high cost of integration for software solutions. Rolls-Royce, in co-operation with a number of other companies, has developed a new communication standard based on open protocols, providing a data centric method of connecting driverless instruments. These protocols include the use of DDS (Data Distribution Service), a communications middleware standard provided by the OMG (Object Management Group), and IEEE 1588v2 PTP (Precision Time Protocol) for time synchronisation. The objective of this standard is to improve the integration speed and reliability of new signal conditioning and acquisition devices, and hence increase the flexibility of both ourselves and the industry as a whole. This paper describes the protocol for Real-Time sharing of data developed over the last 4 years, the use-cases it is intended to solve and the vision for future development of the protocol.
