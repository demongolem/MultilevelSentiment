No posts where found Sponge Copper Market To Witness Enhanced Growth Owing To Rising Demand From Automotive And Aircraft Sectors Till 2022 | Million Insights August 16 Share it With Friends Million Insights â€“ World's Fastest Growing Market Research Database According to new report available with Million Insights, The specific applications of copper in industries includes power cables and wires, jelly filled cables, building wires, air-conditioning and refrigeration tubing. The use of copper also pertains to telecom, power, construction, transportation, handicrafts, engineering, consumer durable, defense and its use is highly dependent on the performance of these sectors. The global sponge copper market is expected to display splendid growth in forthcoming period. Sponge copper is the by-product of sulfide ores that have been processed for ages in Zaire and Zambia by roast-leach-electrowin process (RLE) process. The sulfides are then concentrated and roasted to produce an oxidized iron â€“ copper sinter. This sinter is also sent to the leaching vats where copper is leached and recovered directly from the leach solution, a low-grade copper cathode is produced which must be refined electrolytically. The byproduct is recovered by an RLE process. Sulfuric acid is usually added to the leaching fluid and form the leaching tanks, copper sulphate is passed to the iron launders. The launders contain troughs consisting of sponge iron or iron scrap. The iron reacts with copper sulfate solution to precipitate a black sand called cement copper that is 90% copper. The sulfur is burned off dissipating heat for the operation and iron converts to iron oxide to form a slag lighter than copper. Full Research Report On Global Sponge Copper Market Analysis available at: https://www.millioninsights.com/industry-reports/sponge-copper-market Copper is a key metal for industrial applications owing to high electrical conductivity, corrosion resistance, ductility, malleability and rigidity. A local demand for sulphuric acid is manufactured by the sulfur dioxide process in the reverberatory furnace and the converter using considerable water. The specific applications of copper in industries includes power cables and wires, jelly filled cables, building wires, air-conditioning and refrigeration tubing. The use of copper also pertains to telecom, power, construction, transportation, handicrafts, engineering, consumer durable, defense and its use is highly dependent on the performance of these sectors.
