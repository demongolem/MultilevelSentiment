Consumer reviews suggest that Plantronics Bluetooth headphones may be defective, resulting in the headset not holding a charge and failing prematurely.
Plantronics Bluetooth headphones are generally considered to be of high quality, and consumers of the brand expect that quality of all of their products. The Backbeat Fit Plantronics wireless headset, which retails on Plantronics' website for $129.99, has become the subject of ire for many consumers, with around 200 one-star reviews on the product's page.
Dozens of reviewers have voiced the same concern: they charge their Plantronics wireless headset and it seems like it charges, but it won't power on despite charging. This problem allegedly occurs after minimal usage, or straight out of the package.
On the ifixit website, a community website where users can help each other troubleshoot and fix electronics, numerous other consumers have expressed their frustration with similar battery and charging problems.
Plantronics has responded to reviews on its own website, suggesting a reset of the device to fix the problem. The reset process is as follows: "Press and hold the Power button for 10 seconds â€“ Without releasing the Power button, plug the BB FIT in the charger â€“ Release the Power button â€“ Unplug the BB FIT from the charger â€“ Test the unit."
For some consumers, this complicated reset process seems to work. Other customers have posted on ifixit that they've had some success by taking the headphones apart and tinkering with the wiring as a temporary fix.
But the majority of consumers do not have the knowledge or skills to take apart their product safely, and are left with no solution to their broken Plantronics wireless headset. Some consumers have even had their device replaced by Plantronics, only to have the same issue with charging and power.
Amidst the reviews of malfunctioning devices and suggestions for fixes, many consumers express their frustration with Plantronics. Some of these consumers say they have been working with the company for months to replace the ongoing problems with their Plantronics wireless headset with no end in sight. Other consumers were allegedly told that Plantronics could not help them replace their devices.
Some consumers have called for legal action against the company, irate at paying a higher price for a Plantronics wireless headset that doesn't work.
"Class action anyone?" one consumer suggested. "Plantronics should replace with working and non-defective products. You can't fix, they won't replace. I am not a sue happy person, but paying $130 and nothing working makes me RED!"
