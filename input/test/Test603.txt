More than half of workers think they are being monitored at work, according to a new study.
Research by the TUC showed that 56 per cent believed they were the victims of workplace surveillance.
Examples included bosses checking internet use, recording time away from work duties and even the use of facial recognition software to assess workers' moods.
The study of 2,100 adults also found two out of three employees, (66 per cent, believe the trend fuels distrust and discrimination and could be used to set unfair targets. Read More Unemployment down by 6,000 in the North West
More, 70 per cent, think that surveillance is likely to become more common in the future.
A third of those polled believe their social media activity is being "snooped on" when they are not at work.
In its report, entitled 'I'll be watching you', the TUC concluded that trade unions should have a legal right to be consulted on and to agree in advance the use of electronic monitoring and surveillance at work and that the government should ensure employers can only monitor their staff for legitimate reasons that protect the interests of workers.
Frances O'Grady, TUC general secretary said: "Employers must not use tech to control and micromanage their staff.
"Monitoring toilet breaks, tracking every movement and snooping on staff outside of working hours creates fear and distrust, and it undermines morale.
"New technologies should not be used to whittle away our right to privacy, even when we're at work. Employers should discuss and agree workplace monitoring policies with their workforces - not impose them upon them. Read More How Barclays are banking on a new breed of tech workers
"Unions can negotiate agreements that safeguard workers' privacy while still making sure the job gets done, but the law needs to change too, so that workers are better protected against excessive and intrusive surveillance."
