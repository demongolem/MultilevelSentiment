2018-10-30 Wireless Sensor Networks â€“ Design Methodology, Challenges and Guidelines for Avionic Systems 2018-01-1951 Avionics industry is moving towards more electric & lightweight aircrafts. Wireless sensor networks help in achieving the same. There are numerous challenges in implementing the wireless sensor networks in safety critical as well as non-safety critical systems on board aircraft. Traditional design methods of wireless sensors network will not be sufficient in an Aircraft environment. In general this increases the complexity of in-flight wireless sensor hardware elements and network. This paper discusses the safety critical and non-safety critical sensor networks in an Aircraft. Security aspects of wireless sensor network at physical layer as well as higher layers. Also presents the outcome of the study with respect to isolation of the Wireless Sensor Network from external networks and neighboring network of other aircraft. This paper puts forth the discussion on Architectural approaches, benefits, suitable architecture and design methodology for higher Development Assurance Levels (DAL) A/B against the lower DAL levels. Provides probable listing of the hardware capabilities of the network nodes and router to support DAL A/B. Provides detail discussion on RF frontend, performance parameters, most affected parameters and guidelines for design of the same. Same is true for the baseband design with respect to Modulation/Demodulation techniques, encryption and propose Model similar to OSI Model. It provides the guidelines for wireless qualification, testing and performance verification/validation. Suitable methods, approaches, best practices and relevant guidance to achieve the successful qualification of wireless sensor and network devices in an Aircraft environment. This paper discusses the comparative study made for the different routing algorithms for energy efficiency, power saving, probable network topologies and shortest path. An attempt is made to propose the most power efficient routing algorithm/method for wireless sensor network in an Aircraft environment. It provides discussion on applicability of real time concepts like Worst Case Execution Time (WCET), deterministic behavior, specific algorithms required to address while designing Wireless Sensor Network based systems. It also provides insight into the various methods of managing WCET via specific RTOS, software writing to invoke scheduler, linker etc. This paper puts forth the various challenges like size constraints, isolation requirements, power consumption, cost, weight, energy efficient algorithm, architectural tradeoffs, RF Frontend, base band design, interference, WCET, failure modes, scalability, availability and reliability of various wireless sensors, network devices and system. The paper makes an effort to provide the possible guidelines to address the same. Ref.:- 1. RTCA/DO-160, Environmental Conditions and Test Procedures for Airborne Equipment 2.
