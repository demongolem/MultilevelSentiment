Indoor Positioning and Indoor Navigation (IPIN) Market â€“ Opportunities, Challenges, Strategies , 17 August 2018 -- Indoor Positioning and Indoor Navigation (IPIN) Market â€“ Opportunities, Challenges, StrategiesGlobal Indoor Positioning and Indoor Navigation (IPIN) Market An indoor positioning and indoor navigation (IPIN) system is a network of devices used to locate people and objects inside a building wirelessly. Whereas navigation is concerned with finding places in large office buildings, museums, university buildings and malls, indoor positioning and indoor navigation (IPIN) solutions improve accuracy of Wi-Fi based navigation and positioning. Earlier GPS devices were used intensively, as these devices were robust for outdoor environments. However, GPS signals are unavailable in indoor environments. Advanced indoor positioning and indoor navigation devices and solutions ensure better connectivity, access and indoor navigation.
