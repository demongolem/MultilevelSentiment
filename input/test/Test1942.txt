Alberto Moreno, who is in the final 12 months of his contract, is pushing hard to play at left-back, while Fabinho â€“ the Â£43.7million signing from Monaco â€“ is also eager for a chance to impress.<br />One man, though, who wonâ€™t feature is Dejan Lovren, who continues to recover from a pelvic injury sustained at the World Cup. The most likely starting point for his season is expected to be the trip to Tottenham on September 15.<br />â€˜We will see,â€™ said Klopp when asked if he was considering changes. â€˜I think that must be always an option; we had enough sessions so I donâ€™t think it makes sense to stick to a team only because we won.<br />â€˜Thatâ€™s the most important thing but we have quality in the squad and there can be different reasons to change the line-up so thatâ€™s possible of course.<br />Klopp says Dejan Lovren is targeting a first-team return after the international break<br />Midfielder Fabinho (right) is vying for a place in the Liverpool team to play against Brighton<br />â€˜Dejan is coming closer but heâ€™s not really around team training in the moment. Iâ€™m not 100% certain what heâ€™s doing today because we are the day before the game.<br />â€˜He will not be involved in that game, Iâ€™m pretty sure no chance for the Leicester game and then, hopefully, after the international break, he will be ready to go.<br />â€˜That would be nice. That was actually the target from the first day when he was in and we knew about his problems. We thought, â€˜Okay, if we can give him that time, then that would be cool.â€™â€™<br />RELATED ARTICLES<br /
