Nano metrology has an important part in order to produce Nano materials and devices with a high degree of accuracy and reliability in Nano manufacturing. A challenge in Nano metrology is to develop or create new measurement standards and techniques to meet the needs of next-generation advanced manufacturing, which will rely on nanometer scale materials and technologies. The requirements for estimation and portrayal of new specimen structures and attributes far exceed the capabilities of current measurement science. Foreseen advances in emerging nanotechnology industries will require revolutionary metrology with high determination and accuracy that has previously been imagined.Applications of Nano Metrology:Applications of nanotechnologies consist a source of complicated technologies and include sectors, from health industry, energy industry, food industry, computer science industry or transports industry. According to an inventory which was carried out in 2011 as part of the American initiative, nanoparticles and Nano materials can thus already be found in more than 1,300 commercial products.Nano Metrology market segmentation:Nano Metrology market segmentation by product type: Microscope
