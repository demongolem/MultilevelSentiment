. We've been talking for weeks about how no one should ignore Nola in the deGrom vs. Scherzer debates, and he was the best performer on Thursday.<br />Nola went eight scoreless innings, striking out<br />Bryce Harper<br />with two on and a two-run lead with his final pitch to end the eighth.<br />He only gave up five hits while walking one and striking out nine. Scherzer allowed just a two-run<br />Odubel Herrera<br />homer in his seven innings. He struck out 10 against four walks and only gave up two hits.<br />Meanwhile, in Queens, deGrom allowed just one run in six innings and was saddled with the loss. Like Scherzer, he had 10 strikeouts and four walks. Bumgarner went eight strong, giving up just one run while striking out eight. He looked like his old self, and the Mets had actually been hitting well of late.<br />Still, it's about the trio of Cy Young contenders, all of whom should also be in MVP consideration.<br />Here's how their full-season lines look now:<br />deGrom is 8-8 with a 1.71 ERA, 0.97 WHIP and 214 strikeouts in 174 innings.<br />Scherzer is 16-6 with a 2.13 ERA, 0.89 WHIP and 244 strikeouts in 181 2/3 innings.<br />Nola is 15-3 with a 2.13 ERA, 0.97 WHIP and 169 strikeouts in 169 innings.<br />This thing is going down to the wire, isn't it? Regardless, Thursday was good for Nola.<br />Most importantly, he stopped the Phillies' four-game losing streak.<br />Acuna gets revenge against the Marlins<br /
