June 21, 2018<br />Lucio&#8217;s public persona sees him frequently retweeting accolades for his female peers. He&#8217;s been named the No. 2 most influential CMO by Forbes, and has received awards from PR Week and Women In Marketing for pushing diversity. At HP, he helped launched the #MoreLikeMe campaign to increase the number of women in leadership roles, growing their percentage amongst top HP marketing jobs from 20 percent to 50 percent. He credits this with contributing to a 6 percent year-over-year boost in HP&#8217;s brand preference scores. You can see him talk more about the initiative on Cheddar above.<br />Sandberg writes that &#8220;Antonio has a lot of experience leading marketing for major brands like HP and Visa &#8212; and heâ€™s been recognized for both his talents and commitment to diversity.&#8221; She&#8217;ll benefit from the help repairing Facebook&#8217;s brand after a string of troubles ranging from Cambridge Analytica to election interference, slowing user growth to worries that too much Facebooking can hurt our well-being. A<br />job listing<br />for the CMO role mentioned candidates would need to be able to &#8220;guide a brand&#8217;s reputation and experience in crisis management.&#8221;<br />Facebook has recently undertaken a massive apology ad campaign on TV, bus stops and elsewhere, touting that it understands its responsibility to keep elections and users&#8217; data safe. But Lucio will need to translate all of Facebook&#8217;s nitty-gritty behind-the-scenes work on these issues into comprehensible messaging that keeps users from straying from the social network.<br />Meanwhile, he&#8217;ll also be in charge of Facebook product marketing. With so many features packed into the app and fighting for attention, Lucio will have to decide what to highlight and how. The question is whether he&#8217;ll think more holistically, supporting the natural cannibalization of Facebook by its fresher-faced acquisitions, or put big blue first.<br />â€œPurpose and impact have been at the center of every career decision that I have ever made,&#8221; Lucio told TechCrunch in a statement. â€œFacebook is one of the worldâ€™s most impactful brands, at a pivotal moment in its history. I am honored to join the team and support its evolution.â€� Indeed, it&#8217;s time for Facebook to evolve, but Lucio will have to prove he can be the wartime leader it needs.<br /
