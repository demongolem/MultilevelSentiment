Previously, Obg-like ATPase 1 (OLA1) was shown to interact with BARD1, a heterodimer partner of BRCA1. OLA1 binds to BRCA1, BARD1, and Î³-tubulin and functions in centrosome regulation. This study determined that overexpression of wild-type OLA1 (OLA1-WT) caused centrosome amplification due to centriole overduplication in mammary tissueâ€“derived cells. Centrosome amplification induced by overexpression of the cancer-derived OLA1 mutant, which is deficient at regulating centrosome number, occurred in significantly fewer cells than in that induced by overexpression of OLA1-WT. Thus, it was hypothesized that overexpression of OLA1 with normal function efficiently induces centrosome amplification, but not that of OLA1 mutants, which are deficient at regulating centrosome number. We analyzed whether overexpression of OLA1 missense mutants of nine candidate phosphorylation residues, three residues modified with acetylation, and two ATP-binding residues caused centrosome amplification and identified five missense mutants that are deficient in the regulation of centrosome number. Three of them did not bind to BARD1. Two phosphomimetic mutations restored the binding to BARD1 and the efficient centrosome amplification by their overexpression. Knockdown and overexpression of BARD1 also caused centrosome amplification. BARD1 mutant reported in cancer failed to bind to OLA1 and rescue the BARD1 knockdown-induced centrosome amplification and reduced its centrosomal localization. Combined, these data reveal that the OLA1â€“BARD1 interaction is important for the regulation of centrosome number. Implications: Regulation of centrosome number by BRCA1/BARD1 together with OLA1 is important for the genome integrity to prevent tumor development. Mol Cancer Res; 1â€“13. Â©2018 AACR.
