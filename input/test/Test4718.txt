If I am offered opening slot in Tests, will be ready for it: Rohit Sharma
Team India on Thursday sweated it out in the nets ahead of the third Test against England at Trent Bridge. India are 2-0 down at Trent Bridge and need to win the match to stay alive in the five-match series. The BCCI posted a video of pacers Ishant Sharma , Mohammed Shami and Umesh Yadav going about their routines.
India had suffered a crushing innings defeat in the second Test at Lord's in a match that had already been cut short by rains. On a pitch on which England pacers James Anderson, Chris Woakes and Stuart Broad wreaked havoc, India's decision to go with two spinners Ravichandran Ashwin and a rather ineffective Kuldeep Yadav was questioned. #TeamIndia 's pace battery sweating it out in the nets ahead of the 3rd Test against England. #ENGvIND pic.twitter.com/mubxGaVIT
