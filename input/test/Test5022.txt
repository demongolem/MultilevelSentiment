Mark Blazis: Proper protection is essential in outdoors Mark Blazis Thursday Aug 16, 2018 at 4:09 PM Aug 16, 2018 at 11:28 PM
There are 4,000 people In Massachusetts who won't read this column â€” but wish they did. They'll be part of a tragic, annual statistic of new Lyme disease victims in our commonwealth. Regretfully, every one of them could have gone into the outdoors in total safety with the proper protection.
Total protection from mosquitoes and ticks boils down to religiously wearing permethrin-sprayed clothing. For decades, I've been shielded from malarial mosquitoes, other biting insects, and ticks â€” especially in dangerous areas like Amazonia, India, Africa â€” and Martha's Vineyard, by just spraying my clothing in my back yard with permethrin or buying clothing pre-infused with permethrin. Everyone venturing outdoors should do so, too.
I spray my own clothing that's dedicated just for the outdoors with Sawyer Permethrin, which you can buy at Cabela's, Dick's, Walmart, Target, R.E.I., Amazon, and directly from Sawyer. I spray on a sunny, windless day, upwind of my laid-out clothing in the back yard so as not to breathe in any of the spray. Two to four hours of drying of the saturated fabrics hung up on my dogwood and pear trees is normally sufficient. Careful ironing afterward, though not necessary, can make the application even longer lasting. But no matter how much you saturate your fabrics, clothing pre-treated with permethrin at the factory will be protective over a much longer period of time. However, both provide priceless immunity.
Confirming my experience with factory pre-sprayed Insect Shield clothing, a new U.S. government study showed that the garments, which our military has been using for more than three decades, either quickly caused ticks to fall off or rendered them unable to bite. Sprayed on at home, permethrin-treated clothing is protective for six weeks or six washings. Factory-treated clothing provides protection through an amazing 70 washings.
The reason for the huge difference in duration of effectiveness is that the Sawyer permethrin that's available to the public is applied at only .5 percent levels. At that dosage, it has been deemed safe for children or pregnant women. At the factory, the clothing is more saturated with a much higher percentage of permethrin that's not available to the public.
One new service that Insect Shield is offering is spraying clothes that people send in. Treating them professionally means they'll protect you through 70 washings. This service, which costs $9.95 per item, could be of value for not only individuals with special clothing but also teams or companies with uniforms. Garments being sent in have to be washed to be acceptable. Undergarments are not permitted for treatment. Dry clean only items can't be sprayed.
If you want to spray your own clothing, as I do, you can buy Insect Shield permethrin spray for $9.95. It's suggested for footwear, clothing, backpacks and even tents. It repels ticks, fleas, flies, chiggers and spiders for up to 60 days. Unlike DEET, it doesn't harm any fabrics or finishes. One can of spray will treat two outfits.
Storage of treated clothing in the dark prolongs permethrin's effectiveness as ultraviolet light exposure slowly degrades it. Water alone won't wash out permethrin, so you can swim, sweat or be exposed to the rain without shortening its effectiveness. Though not necessary, hand washing is preferable because heavy agitation washing in a washing machine slowly decreases its protection.
If you're unfamiliar with permethrin, it's truly wonderful. Some might appreciatively say with well warranted hyperbole that it's even magical. Chemically, it's a synthetic form of the insect-repelling compound, pyrethrin, which is naturally present in chrysanthemum flowers. Used primarily in insect sprays designed to bond with clothing, not skin, it also can be found in special shampoos and creams that are prescribed to fight severe lice and scabies problems.
Both the Journal of Medical Entomology and the U.S. Center for Disease Control have confirmed permethrin's remarkable protection. While we can't feel or smell permethrin â€” the latter innocuous quality makes it perfect for deer hunters â€” ticks reflexively are repelled by it. Further research has shown protective benefits when applied to short-sleeved shirts and short pants. Shoes, socks and boots should be treated for maximum protection.
I always buy Insect Shield's permethrin-impregnated long-sleeved shirts for the tropics, as they're protective against both insects and the sun. The lightweight Ex-Officio shirts and pants conveniently also dry quickly after a rain-forest outburst. If conditions are really bad, I'll spray my face, hands and neck as well with repellents designed for skin protection.
Surprisingly, Sawyer Permethrin can be applied directly to dogs for 35 days of protection from mosquitoes and fleas and six weeks of protection from ticks. (Application instructions for pets can be found at www.sawyer.com/dogs/.)
The best overall repellent to apply on our body is picaridin, which is a synthesized form of piperine, a chemical in pepper sold by several repellent companies. Unlike high quantities of DEET, which could be carcinogenic, picaridin is harmless to humans. In the dangerous tick and mosquito areas, you should spray your clothing with permethrin and your exposed skin with picaridin. That dual strategy should make you immune to attacks.
Sawyer Picaridin (20 percent), which I've been relying mostly on, lasts 12 hours, is more effective than DEET on Central and South American mosquito species, and unlike DEET, won't harm synthetic materials. DEET deteriorated the coating on one safari mate's binoculars. Picaridin is even considered safe for children over six months and pregnant women. In the glove compartment of my Denali, I've got a second container of picaridin spray made by Repel. It's protective for 10 hours. Because of the superiority of picaridin, I'm no longer using DEET products like OFF, Ben's, and Muskol any more, though for decades, they saved me from the ravages of black flies and mosquitoes in Alaska and Labrador.
Back home, we can also be pestered in our yards and on our decks. Thermacell, headquartered in Bedford, has come up with some effective new products to place outdoors to repel mosquitoes and ticks. Working here, they know how to deal with Massachusetts bugs. I've successfully used their Patio Shield, which covers a 15-by-15-foot zone effectively, on my deck at the Cape. It has worked on the hottest, most humid nights by releasing a repellent into the air from a heat-activated mat. Each container comes with a 12-hour butane cartridge and 3 mosquito repelling mats that last four hours each. I found upwind placement of their product to be most effective.
Thermacell's Radius zone mosquito repellent protects a 110-square-foot area, is scent free, uses no spray, and is rechargeable. Refills are available in 12- and 40-hour sizes. It's a durable little unit, great for travel, and placement outside â€” again best positioned upwind.
Thermacell has also cleverly come out with Tick Control Tubes for eliminating ticks around yards and wooded lots. The tubes, which are filled with permethrin-impregnated nesting material that mice quickly find and take to their nests, are placed flat 10 yards apart on the ground in brushy areas and around rotting logs. Mice are tick magnets. Once the permethrin is brought to the mouse nests, it kills the ticks that collect on the mice. The designed should be applied twice a year between April 1 and mid-September. Best results come from applying just prior to the feeding activity periods for tick nymphs from May through June and larvae from August through September, so if you want to effectively control ticks on your property, you should make an application now.
For years, I've effectively relied on Thermacell's butane product up in a tree stand during the hot, humid September Connecticut opening of bow season.
Whatever products you use, for your clothes, your skin, or your property, after being afield, always check your body immediately after coming home, wash your clothes, and shower, preferably within two hours. With this full-spectrum protection strategy, everyone can go outdoors fearlessly, even in the most infested places, laugh at mosquitoes, and â€” most importantly â€” permanently keep ourselves out of the Lyme disease victim statistics.
