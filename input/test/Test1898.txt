After the match you lose, it is always difficult, especially for people that really care about the job, about being a football professional, but after that you think about the next match.<br />â€˜You do the same when you win. You have to move on and focus what next and when you lose you have to do even more.<br />â€˜I feel we played well against Leicester and we won, I felt we played bad against Brighton and we lost. I would like to play well and win. It's to play well and win, don't make mistakes, that's what we want.â€™<br />The United boss insisted it had not been a difficult week despite Brighton loss last weekend<br />Asked about Mondayâ€™s game against Tottenham at Old Trafford, which has now taken on greater significance, Mourinho replied: â€˜I'm not going to comment.â€™<br />Is it the right game at the right time then? â€˜You have to play against 19 opponents at Old Trafford and away, you have to play against everyone, I don't know if it's the right time. The time is now.<br />â€˜The fixtures were decided this way and we have to play Tottenham in the second match at Old Trafford and then we go away twice in a row Burnley and Watford, this is what it is. Of course, a difficult match, a team that last season finished in the top-four.â€™<br />He was also blunt when asked about his relationship with chief executive Ed Woodward<br />There was better news for Mourinho on the injury front with Nemanja Matic, Antonio Valencia and new signing Diogo Dalot back in training, although it remains to be seen if they face Spurs.<br />â€˜I don't know because today is still Friday and we have training Saturday and Sunday, and a match on Monday.<br />'There are decisions to be made on Sunday but, yes (Matic and Valencia are) training with the team, Dalot also training with the team for the first time this week, so in terms of medical department they are almost free.â€™<br />RELATED ARTICLES<br /
