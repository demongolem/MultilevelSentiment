Chloe Madeley opens up on sexy pics â€“ and how parents Richard & Judy cope
Still, that hasn't stopped Chloe Madeley from flashing the flesh as she showcases her fit body in some seriously skimpy ensembles.
Taking to her official Instagram account this week, it was business as usual for the bombshell blonde, as she posed up a storm for one of her sexiest snaps yet.
Wearing a sky-high, bum-grazing thong swimsuit, the personal trainer and online coach turned her back to the camera to ensure all eyes were on her very peachy behind.
As she ran her hands through her golden locks, the 30-year-old overlooked a picturesque view of a swimming pool and some green hills - although onlookers were more likely distracted by her bodacious behind.
She captioned the sizzling snap with a small raindrop emoji.
And its hardly surprising that Chloe soon found herself inundated with comments from her 187k Instagram followers, who were seemingly overjoyed with the bum-baring display.
