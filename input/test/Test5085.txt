Red Bulls face road test in Vancouver
 13:49 GMT+10
There is a logjam at the top of Eastern Conference, and one of those teams, the New York Red Bulls, has a tricky couple matches coming up.
The second-place Red Bulls travel to the Pacific Coast to face the Vancouver Whitecaps on Saturday at BC Place in Vancouver, B.C., before returning to New York to take on third-place New York City FC on Wednesday in the Bronx.
"There's just little room for error, especially against good teams on the road," Red Bulls head coach Chris Armas team's website. "Vancouver has shown that if you're not ready to play, it's a long way to go to get your butt kicked."
Saturday's game is the Red Bulls' second of a three-game road trip that began Aug. 11 with a 1-0 win in Chicago.
Bradley Wright-Phillips provided the game's only goal to become the first player in MLS history with 15 goals in five straight seasons.
The Red Bulls (15-6-2) and NYCFC are even with 47 points -- the Red Bulls have the advantage in wins (15-14) and goal differential (22-17) -- and trail first-place Atlanta United by one point. NYCFC plays at Philadelphia on Saturday; Atlanta is home to take on Columbus on Sunday.
The two New York teams are eight points clear of Columbus, which holds fourth place by nine points over Philadelphia.
The Whitecaps (9-9-6) put an end to the Portland Timbers' 15-game unbeaten streak with a 2-1 win on Aug. 11. It was also the Timbers' first home loss of 2018.
"Vancouver is a good team, they're especially good at home and they've always given us problems," Armas said of the Whitecaps, who are 5-2-4 at BC Place this season. "Typically known for stingy defensively, comfortable in a deeper block defensively and that sets up for a counterattack, which they're number one in the league in counterattacks and transitions. It is by design, but they can sit back, be organized, disciplined and catch you going the other way."
While Vancouver's MLS win over Portland brought it within striking distance of the playoff line -- the seventh-place Whitecaps trail Real Salt Lake by two points -- the team is coming off a midweek disappointment.
Toronto FC routed Canadian Championship. The teams played to a 2-2 draw in the first leg of the finals the previous week.
"Going into the tie, we knew it was going to be difficult," Vancouver head coach Carl Robinson said. "Forget about the results in league play sometimes -- on the day, we knew if their big players turned up it was going to be difficult."
The Whitecaps, who have two wins and a draw in their past three MLS matches, now return their focus to league play.
"It's a hard one. Obviously, losing in a final ... it's always hurtful," center back Kendall Waston told the Vancouver Sun. "What we have in front of us is the MLS Cup, so we need to qualify for the playoffs and we're now focused on that. Now we have to reset and try to create the same momentum we had two games before this one.
