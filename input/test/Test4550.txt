A drink-driver caught nearly seven times the limit started a six-month jail sentence this week.
Cops found Peter McPhillips staggering around the B723 road after abandoning his car.
Officers heading north on the M74 near Ecclefechan had earlier seen the 45-year-old's vehicle swerving from one lane to another. Several drivers had to take evasive action and the car almost rammed the central barrier.
Police lost sight of the vehicle, Dumfries Sheriff Court heard, but 10 minutes later were alerted by reports of a driver having to swerve to avoid a head-on smash on the B723.
When they finally caught up with McPhillips, he had ditched the car and they soon discovered he had almost seven times the legal alcohol limit in his breath.
McPhillips, of St Ninian's Road, Moffat , who had two previous convictions over 10 years ago, admitted committing the offence at the weekend near Lockerbie and Hoddom Castle at Ecclefechan.
He also pleaded guilty to driving dangerously on the M74 and the B723 road repeatedly in an erratic manner, swerving across the roadway and causing other drivers to take evasive action to avoid colliding with him.
Fiscal depute Pamela Rhodes said it was 6.30pm when police received reports about a vehicle being driven in an erratic manner, swerving all over the road.
Then police driving north on the M74 near Ecclefechan saw the car driving from one lane to another, almost colliding with the central barrier and other drivers taking evasive action to avoid it.
They lost sight of it as it went off the motorway but 10 minutes later they received reports of a driver having to swerve to avoid a collision with a car coming straight towards him and then found the car abandoned off the edge of the roadway.
McPhillips was staggering on the roadway and smelling of drink. He failed a roadside breath test.
A solicitor said that McPhillips, who had been working in the Carlisle area, had had problems with drink.
Sheriff Brian Mohan also banned McPhillips from driving for two years, ordered him to re-sit a test before regaining his licence and ordered the forfeiture of his car.
Meanwhile, another man has escaped being locked up despite being caught over the limit for the third time.
Shaun Taylor, who at the time was living in Longtown, but has now moved north of the border to Chapelknowe, was warned by Sheriff David Young at Dumfries that because the previous offences were both more than 10 years ago, he would imposed a community payback order.
The 33-year-old was ordered to carry out 160 hours unpaid work and was banned from the road for 24 months.
He had admitted driving with four times the legal limit in his breath in June and also driving carelessly on the A75 near Annan, losing control of his vehicle and colliding with a fence and a hedge.
The court was told that nearby residents heard the crash and rushed to help and found Taylor smelling of drink.
Solicitor Roger Colledge said Taylor had been working in the Dumfries area and had gone out for a drink with some work colleagues, intending to stay the night in the town.
But he then found the place was unavailable and thought he might stay in the car but once there made a "stupid decision" to drive.
He added that Taylor didn't remember making the decision to drive.
Inspector Campbell Moffat of the Roads Policing Unit of Police Scotland at Dumfries, slammed the pair yesterday and warned others that drink driving won't be tolerated.
He said: "It's simply not acceptable in this day and age for anyone to get behind the wheel of a vehicle when under the influence of drink or drugs.
"The fact that more than 50 per cent of all drivers detected for driving whilst unfit due to drink or drugs are as a result of a report by a member of the public clearly shows that society are not content to stand by and wait for the consequences of such actions.
"We applaud this attitude and would ask that anyone who suspects that a driver is under the influence of drink or drugs to contact Police Scotland through the 999 system.
"Those who drink or take drugs and drive risk not only their own life but that of their passengers and other road users.
"Our patrols are on the road 24/7 and Police Scotland will not tolerate such irresponsible behaviour and will continue to target drink and drug driving until the message gets through." Like us on Faceboo
