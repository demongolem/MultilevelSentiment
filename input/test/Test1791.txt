,<br />Aug. 24, 2018<br />/PRNewswire/ -- &quot;On 3 April, trading in Immunovia's shares started on NASDAQ Stockholm's main market, where we are listed in the Mid Cap segment. During the second quarter we also completed a directed share issue worth around<br />SEK 324 million<br />Sweden<br />and internationally.<br />Very exciting results have been achieved in two major application areas, lung cancer and rheumatoid arthritis, which show that the general usability of the IMMrayâ„¢ platform opens up great opportunities for Immunovia.<br />During the spring and summer we completed a lung cancer study with very good results. This was our first collaboration with a global, top-ten pharmaceutical business and the aim was to assess the technical performance of the IMMrayâ„¢ platform within lung cancer.<br />In the autoimmune field we have made significant progress within rheumatoid arthritis. In August we published results that mean we will now continue our efforts aimed at developing a product for patients that are difficult to diagnose in this area.<br />The main focus, as usual, was on IMMrayâ„¢ PanCan-d. Work has proceeded according to plan in the second quarter. In August, however, new data emerged showing that the sample-collection procedure, which will be applicable commercially and for our final validation studies, affects our product's algorithms. We have therefore decided that a necessary stage is to optimize IMMrayâ„¢ PanCan-d to safeguard the quality of the test results prior to release. This will delay the start of sales to the latter part of 2019,&quot; said<br />Mats Grahn<br /
