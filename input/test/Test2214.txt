R epresentatives of conservation body Viet Nature will visit Cumbria next week in an exchange visit to see how forestry and conservation work in Cumbria.
They will visit sites such as Hardknott and Grizedale forests and join in with practical conservation activities. Hosted by Restoring Hardknott Forest and the Forestry Commission the visitors will stay in the Duddon valley and enjoy some Cumbrian scenery and hospitality whilst discussing their common interests in forest conservation.
They will be staying in the Duddon Valley from 22-24th August and whilst there will tour both Hardknott and Grizedale forests and get involved in the monitoring of regenerating forest and the use of remote camera traps to observe local wildlife.
Restoring Hardknott Forest is a group working with the Forestry Commission to return the 600 hectare site at Hardknott to native forest by planting of native trees such as oak, and the removal of non-native tree species.
Viet Nature is a organisation working to enhance and preserve the biodiversity and wildlife of Vietnam. The last few years has seen a developing partnership between Viet Nature and UK conservation bodies such as the RSPB and Birdlife International. This has included a recent visit from Forestry Commission and Restoring Hardknott Forest staff members
Hardknott Forest Project Officer John Hodgson says "We are delighted to be welcoming such experienced conservationists and researchers to Hardknott Forest and we are sure to learn a lot from each other's projects".
Professor Dominick Spracklen of Leeds University School of Earth and Environment, and advisor to Restoring Hardknott Forest, recently visited Vietnam. "After several visit to conduct research in the forests of Vietnam it is fantastic that we are able to organise this exchange visit and welcome staff from Viet Nature to Cumbria".
After their time in Cumbria, the researchers will travel to Paignton Zoo in Devon as part of their plans to reintroduce the Edward's pheasant to the Vietnamese jungle. The zoo currently has a successful breeding program for this bird which has sadly been eradicated from it's native home in Vietnam. Share this
