It was a good opportunity for us and him to come and make good progress.<br />'We tried to put in place a style of play on the ground with quality, with technical players. It is a good for him because he is not physical, tall or powerful but he has something different.<br />The 21-year-old has plenty of technical quality and the Foxes fought hard to sign him<br />'When I spoke to him I tried to give him the truth. I like to analyse the player to give him my feelings and feedback and to ask questions about his feelings about his play.<br />'I like to tell him how he can develop. He has made a lot of progress without the ball already.<br />'I like to introduce the project of the club and when we look at Leicester it's a club which develops young players.'<br />RELATED ARTICLES<br /
