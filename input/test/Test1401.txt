We have been overwhelmed by the acceleration rate of our registered users and anticipate seeing even faster growth having now received approval from Google. With approximately 50% of mobile phone users operating on Google Android devices, we are expecting to see patient numbers accelerate even quicker than we have experienced so far. NamasteMD is a key component of our strategy in developing<br />Canada's<br />largest medical cannabis patient database and in launching cannabis sales in<br />Canada<br />and abroad. While the process of acquiring a medical cannabis prescription and onboarding with a Licensed Producer typically can take several days or weeks, Namaste will offer a fully-integrated platform for new patients to consult with a nurse practitioner and immediately be connected with Cannmart to order their product. We believe in bringing value to our patients through technological innovation and aim to set the highest standard for patient care going forward.&quot;<br />About Namaste Technologies Inc.<br />Namaste Technologies is Your Everything Cannabis Storeâ„¢.
