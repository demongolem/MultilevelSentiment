Steve McManaman 9/10<br />Liverpool, free transfer - 1999<br />Britainâ€™s second most-successful footballing export to Spain behind Gareth Bale. Signed on a free from Liverpool in 1999 he had the personality to fit into that dressing room and the ability to earn his place in that team.<br />Won the European Cup in his first season scoring a volley in the final and despite huge competition for places remained an important player winning a second Champions League and two leagues before returning to England.<br />Steve McManaman is Britainâ€™s second most-successful footballing export to Spain<br />Nicolas Anelka 6/10<br />Arsenal, Â£23m - 1999<br />Falling out with Vicente del Bosque is one step down from having an argument in an empty room but Anelka managed it at Madrid. He joined from Arsenal in 1999 for Â£23m but like many who struggle at the Bernabeu was played out of position and so struggled for form under coach John Toshack.<br />When Del Bosque came in he still struggled for minutes and eventually went on strike. He was sold to PSG after one season.<br />Nicolas Anelka joined Real Madrid from Arsenal for Â£23million but was played out of position<br />David Beckham 7/10<br />Manchester United, Â£23m - 2003<br />Most players improve from spells abroad but Beckham seemed to stop developing as a player the day he left Manchester United for Â£23m in 2003.<br />He was still a fine midfielder and it wasnâ€™t his fault that his arrival coincided with five managers in three years and no trophies. But rarely played in his best position because Luis Figo played there he trod water in what should have been his greatest years.<br />Still won a league before joining LA Galaxy. And for his commitment, personality, the Hollywood passes, and the occasional brilliant free-kick he is still loved by Real Madrid supporters.<br />David Beckham was another Premier League export played out of position at the Bernabeu<br />Jonathan Woodgate 6/10<br />Newcastle, Â£13m - 2004<br />Fondly remembered in Madrid despite a fairly disastrous time. Signed from Newcastle in 2004 for Â£13m. He arrived injured and when the club forced his return he suffered a relapse and ended up out for a full year before a calamitous debut in which he scored an own-goal and was sent off.<br />Why did the locals like him then? He learned more Spanish than all the other British exports put together, and when he was fit it was clear to all that had more than enough class to become a top Real Madrid defender, if only injuries had allowed.<br />Jonathan Woodgate had a calamitous debut that saw him score an own goal and get sent off<br />Michael Owen 7/10<br />Liverpool, Â£8m - 2004<br />â€˜All he does is score goalsâ€™ moaned some of Madridâ€™s more spoilt fans. It was true that there was nothing fancy about Owen â€“ he just used to put the ball in the net.<br />Despite having to compete with crowd favourite Raul and Ronaldo Nazario, he returned the best goals-per-minutes at the club in his first season after joining from Liverpool for Â£8m. He never really integrated and moved to Newcastle a year later.<br />Michael Owen returned the best goals-per-minutes at the club in his first season at the club<br />Thomas Gravesen 7/10<br />Everton, Â£3m - 2005<br />Legend has it Madrid wanted a holding midfielder and had mixed Gravesen up with Lee Carsley who was also at Everton in 2005. Harshly remembered as a bit of a midfield hooligan Gravesen could actually play when he was allowed to drive forward from midfield.<br />The problem was he was in the same team as Zinedine Zidane and Guti so who do you think was going to end up playing holding midfield? The crowd loved him but when Fabio Capello took over as coach, he dumped the Dane quicker than you can say â€˜training ground fight with Robinhoâ€™.<br />Thomas Gravesen struggled to break into a Madrid midfield of Zinedine Zidane and Guti<br />Jose Antonio Reyes 7/10<br />Arsenal, season-long loan - 2006<br />The man who won the league for Madrid in 2007. They had to beat Mallorca on the last day but were trailing 1-0 when Reyes replaced David Beckham.<br />He scored twice and so it was open top bus parades instead of brickbats for Fabio Capelloâ€™s team. Reyes, who had joined on loan from Arsenal did not stick around though, joining Atletico that summer.<br />Jose Antonio Reyes won the league for Real when he scored twice against Mallorca in 2007<br />Ruud van Nistelrooy 8/10<br />Manchester United, Â£14 - 2006<br />He scored 64 goals in 96 matches and endeared himself to the home supporters with his reliability in front of goal and his patience with the younger, less reliable in front of goal, Gonzalo Higuain, telling him: â€˜goals are like ketchup keep tapping the end of the bottleâ€™. Won a league with Madrid 2007 top scoring in the process.<br />Ruud van Nistelrooy endeared himself to the home fans with his reliability in front of goal<br />Jerzy Dudek 6/10<br />Liverpool, free transfer - 2007<br />The Polish goalkeeper Joined on a free in 2007 but played only 12 games as Iker Casillas dominated. Careers are often about timing and had he arrived a bit later he might have been the keeper Jose Mourinho picked instead of Casillas.<br />Madrid fans were fond of him and he did famously trot round the pitch to pass a note to Casillas who then communicated to Sergio Ramos and Xabi Alonso that they had to get booked in a dead rubber Champions League game against Ajax. They did pick up yellows and were subsequently fined and banned.<br />Jerzy Dudek (pictured with Cristiano Ronaldo) played just 12 times behind Iker Casillas<br />Gabriel Heinze 6/10<br />Manchester United, Â£8m - 2007<br />Signed for Â£8m from Manchester United in 2007, Heinze won a league with Madrid in his first season but was often part of a struggling Real Madrid side in subsequent campaigns as they found it tough to deal with an improving Barcelona. A reliable soldier but United had his best years.<br />Gabriel Heinze played for Real Madrid in an era that they failed to deal with Barcelona<br />Arjen Robben 7/10<br />Chelsea, Â£25m - 2007<br />During one hot-streak he played so well that some enthusiastic Madrid commentators started likening him to Lionel Messi. When he was sold in 2009 after two years at the club, coach Manuel Pellegrini objected.<br />Robben played a Champions League final and a World Cup final in his first season at Bayern so Pellegriniâ€™s grumbleâ€™s were well-founded... although Madrid did replace him with Cristiano Ronaldo.<br />Arjen Robben dazzled for two seasons at Real Madrid after joining from Chelsea in 2007<br />Julien Faubert 4/10<br />West Ham, six-month loan - 2009<br />What were they thinking? In 2009 Real Madrid â€˜swoopedâ€™ for the West Ham wide man after they failed to convince Antonio Valencia to join them before he went to Manchester United.<br />He famously missed one training session because he thought he had been given the day off. He was given most matchdays off, playing just 54 minutes of football. The enduring image of his six-month stay was of him reclining on the substitutesâ€™ bench against Villarreal, legs stretched out, eyelids heavy, napping on the job.<br />Julien Faubert was a strange signing for Madrid when he arrived from West Ham in 2009<br />Cristiano Ronaldo 10/10<br />Manchester United, Â£80m - 2009<br />Stands shoulder to shoulder with Alfredo Di Stefano as the clubâ€™s greatest ever player. His relentless pursuit of goals through nine years served up one of the greatest periods in the clubâ€™s history. Manchester United had brilliant service from him but he found another level in Spain. One that only Messi could live with.<br />Ronaldo's relentless pursuit of goals served up one of the greatest periods in Madrid's history<br />Alvaro Arbeloa 7/10<br />Liverpool, Â£5m - 2009<br />After being signed from Liverpool in 2009 he put in a solid seven-season shift on both flanks as a reliable full-back. One of the best Â£5m deals Madrid ever made.<br />He was also one of the few players not to turn on Mourinho at the end of his three-year spell as coach. Good value for money and still working with the club as an ambassador and television pundit.<br />Alvaro Arbeloa was well-loved at Madrid and put in a solid seven-season shift at the club<br />Lassana Diarra 7/10<br />Portsmouth, Â£19m - 2009<br />An Nâ€™Golo Kante of his time Diarra was sensational in full-flow. Another player who was perfect for the way Mourinho wanted Real Madrid to play especially when he opted for a three-man â€˜dogs of war midfieldâ€™ (he never got that formation past the Madrid purists too often).<br />Diarraâ€™s inability to take orders from the same general for too long eventually saw him move on but it was good while it lasted.<br />Lassana Diarra (right, with Lionel Messi) was sensational when in full flow playing in midfield<br />Xabi Alonso 9/10<br />Liverpool, Â£30m - 2009<br />He was the complete midfielder for Madrid, just as he had been for Liverpool. He could hold in front of the defence, pinching possession and pinging long-distance defence-splitting passes but he could also drive a team forward. May well return to the club one day as coach.<br />Xabi Alonso made a habit of pinging long-distance defence-splitting passes from deep<br />Ricardo Carvalho 7/10<br />Chelsea, Â£7m - 2010<br />His best days were had at Chelsea alongside John Terry but he still served Real Madrid well especially in his first season. Mourinho would love to have a young Carvalho at United now.<br />Ricardo Carvalho served Los Blancos well in his first season after signing from Chelsea<br />Emmanuel Adebayor 6/10<br />Manchester City, six-month loan - 2011<br />Another Mourinho request. He was a useful alternative and Madrid enjoyed his habitual good early form at a new club, allowing him to leave before the inevitable habitual dip in form. He played a part in Mourinhoâ€™s first trophy beating Barcelona in the Copa del Rey final in 2011.<br />Emmanuel Adebayor started well at Madrid before suffering an inevitable habitual dip in form<br />Michael Essien 6/10<br />Chelsea, season-long loan - 2012<br />Turned up on loan from Chelsea in 2012 and referred to Mourinho as his â€˜Daddyâ€™ in his first press conference. He was already past his magnificent best but never let his manager down filling in at full-back as well as midfield.<br />Most Real Madrid supporters were still puzzled as to why the club had signed him and his loan never became permanent.<br />Michael Essien arrived on loan in 2012 and referred to Jose Mourinho as his â€˜Daddyâ€™<br />Luka Modric 9/10<br />Tottenham, Â£30m - 2012<br />Imagine what would have been achieved at Tottenham had they been able to keeper Modric and Bale and still welcome Pochettino and the raft of young homegrown players.<br />Few midfielders have achieved more at Real Madrid. No wonder the club caved in to his contract demands this summer. He was signed by Mourinho â€“ one of Joseâ€™s greatest gifts to the club.<br />Few midfielders have achieved more at the Santiago Bernabeu than Luka Modric has managed<br />Gareth Bale 9/10<br />Tottenham, Â£86m - 2013<br />Would be a 10/10 if not for the injuries that have limited appearances. Has helped inspire four Champions Leagues and one league title scoring some huge goals in massive games including arguably two of the best in the clubâ€™s history â€“ the run from the halfway line in the Copa del Rey final in 2014 and the goal in Kiev against Liverpool last May.<br />Gareth Bale's overhead kick against Liverpool in Kiev is one of the greatest Madrid goals ever<br />Javier Hernandez 6/10<br />Manchester United, season-long loan - 2014<br />Johnny on the spot several times during his brief loan spell, most notably with a goal that settled a Champions League quarter-final against Atletico Madrid in 2014. But a forward needs more than goals in his locker to survive at Madrid and Chicharitoâ€™s time at Real Madrid was short.<br />Javier Hernandez was the most recent Premier League player to join Madrid before Courtois<br />RELATED ARTICLES<br /
