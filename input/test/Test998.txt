Published on Aug 17, 2018 About Books [RECOMMENDATION] The Moral Underground: How Ordinary Americans Subvert an Unfair Economy by Lisa Dodson Online : Called a "fascinating exploration of economic civil disobedience" by "Publishers Weekly, " Lisa Dodson s stunning book "The Moral Underground" features stories of middle-class managers and professionals who refuse to be complicit in an economy that puts a decent life beyond the reach of the working poor. Whether it s a nurse choosing to treat an uninsured child, a supervisor padding a paycheck, or a restaurant manager sneaking food to a worker s children, these unsung heroes reach across the economic fault line to restore a sense of justice to the working world. Selected as the "Writer as Witness" text to be read and discussed by the incoming Class of 2014 at American University, "The Moral Underground" is based on Dodson s eight years of research and conversations with hundreds of Americans about the need to create ethical alternatives to rules that ignore the humanity of working parents and put their children at risk. "The Moral Underground" has been called "powerful" by "The Weekly Sift, ""the documentary tradition at its very best" by Pulitzer Prize-winner Robert Coles, and "inspiring" and "hard hitting" by "Spirituality and Practice" magazine, which wrote, "Dodson does a remarkable job of conveying the sense of deep unfairness that pervades the feelings of these individuals who are paid less than they need to live."Creator : Lisa Dodson Best Sellers Rank : #5 Paid in Kindle Store Link Download News : https://sakidekbinngah.blogspot.com/?book=1595586423 ..
