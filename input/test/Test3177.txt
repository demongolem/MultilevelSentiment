Walmart has christened its new Mobile, Ala., distribution center alongside Gov. Kay Ivy and local officials, the company announced Tuesday. At the grand opening celebration, Ivey highlighted the boon that the DC will offer the Mobile community, including the creation of more 750 jobs once the $135 million facility is fully operational, Walmart said.
"Walmart proves to be a great corporate partner to the state of Alabama, year after year, by investing in its stores, its employees and the surrounding community. Their commitment cannot be better proven than by the opening of this new Distribution Center, which, when fully operational, will provide approximately 750 quality jobs in the Mobile area," Ivey said. "We are grateful to Walmart for supporting the economic health of the Port City, and for the large role they play in propelling our great state forward."
The cross-dock facility was first announced in March 2017, and Walmart said it is part of its efforts to strengthen its supply chain. The 2.6 million-sq.-ft. facility will supply several regional centers supporting roughly 700 Walmart stores in Alabama, Mississippi and other states.
"We are excited about how this facility will help us better serve our customers across the South and beyond while creating a positive economic impact locally through job creation and future development," said Jeff Breazeale, Walmart vice president of direct import logistics. "We are grateful to the state of Alabama, Mobile County, the City of Mobile, the Mobile Area Chamber of Commerce and the Alabama State Port Authority for the warm welcome we have received here, and we look forward to a strong partnership with the community for years to come."
The grand opening also highlighted the roughly $20,0000 that Walmart associates donated to various Mobile-area organizations, including Alma Bryant High School, Theodore High School, Bishop State Community College, St. Elmo Elementary School, Feeding the Gulf Coast, St. Elmo Fire Department and the Mobile County Sheriff's Department
