38<br />Tech support<br />One last note: The Naked Labs team offers very decent tech support. We had a small Bluetooth hiccup early on during testing, and after calling the number in the app, they were able to sort us out within minutes. Plus, I got this nifty scan of myself on the phone with them when they checked to see if their solution worked!<br />Note that this scan didn't return any measurements -- if the mirror detects that you're wearing clothing or that something else is throwing the scan off, it'll let you know that there's something wrong and ask you to scan again.<br />Published:<br /
