Over the last decade, I've hired both interns and marketing graduates for my business. As a full-service marketing consultancy, we work on multichannel marketing for our clients, so I have the opportunity to place graduates where they best fit rather than just throwing them into some mundane marketing work. As an interview gets rolling, I ask, "So, what is it that you'd like to do ?" An answer that I repeatedly get is, "I want to do social media for a company in the [insert industry]." I groan internally and ask, "Can you provide a bit more insight into what you mean by that?" This is when it gets unbearable. The average response to that question could be summed up as follows: "I want to tweet and Instagram for a brand ... you know, like the Wendy's social media account."
They're referring, of course, to Amy Brown, a pioneer of Wendy's snark. But Amy Brown isn't your average corporate social media marketer; she's an amazingly talented copywriter and was on a team with other community managers she felt were just as gifted. That team blazed a careful trail for Wendy's, positioning the brand brilliantly without looking mean or causing a disturbance.
Boiling down a brand's social media strategy to sitting on a couch, responding to tweets and going viral, is simply not reality. You have to sell a lot of hamburgers to cover the salary and benefits of a talented copywriter, and you have to prove that the investment worked. Before the first tweet is ever responded to, there are some critical steps that must be accomplished weeks or months ahead of that first tweet. Here's a breakdown:
â€¢ What is the audience for this marketing initiative?
â€¢ Where is the audience for this marketing initiative?
â€¢ How many resources will this marketing initiative take?
â€¢ Are there efforts that we can coordinate with to maximize this initiative's results?
â€¢ How will we measure whether this initiative is successful?
â€¢ How long will it take to see if this initiative is successful?
â€¢ What did we learn from this marketing initiative that can be applied to the next?
You don't do social media. That's like a sales representative saying, "I want to do telephone for [insert industry]." Social media is a channel, albeit an important one.
Social media has multiple dimensions -- from utilizing it as a research tool and monitoring for brand issues, to providing value for acquisition opportunities and educating for customer retention. It requires technology to manage and assign issues in real time, a response strategy that carefully aligns with the brand's messaging and voice, and even approval processes to ensure compliance.
Social media also integrates and works with virtually every other strategy -- from influencer marketing to paid advertising, to search engine optimization. Not to mention how critical it is to prepare every interaction for measurement and further analysis. Social media is both amazing and quite difficult. Without a great strategy, companies will quickly abandon the important channel after not seeing results. With a great strategy, companies can harness an unlimited audience, build advocacy and see incredible returns on their investment.
As a graduate or student of marketing, I want to hear a much deeper response to this question. Here's the response I'd love to hear just once:
"In my studies at [insert University], I've been especially interested in consumer behavior online and how marketing and public relations can impact it. I'd love the opportunity to work in the [insert industry], study their key demographics, buying behavior and competitive landscape, and then devise a long-term strategy that helps set a company apart from its competitors. Since social media is such a diverse medium with virality, customer service and driving brand awareness, I think I'd like to start there, collaborating and coordinating other resources in the marketing department to help grow the business. I want to help develop the voice of the company across social media. And, after researching your company, it appears I can be coupled with some talented mentors."
Now that's doing social media.
You're hired.
