If you purchased Blue Diamond Vanilla Almond Breeze almond milk that had a use-by date of Sept. 2, 2018, you may have a legal claim.
On Aug. 2, HP Hood LLC, the company that manufactures vanilla Almond Breeze almond milk, announced that some of their vanilla-flavored almond milk was contaminated with cow's milk due to an employee error. Allegedly, the affected milk was sent to 28 states, and each container of the affected milk has a use-by date of Sept. 2, 2018.
HP Hood announced that the company had decided to recall all of the potentially contaminated milk. Almost 150,000 half-gallon containers of vanilla Almond Breeze almond milk are being recalled over the issue.
Though the milk should still be safe for most consumers, consumers who purchase almond milk because they have allergies or sensitivities to cow's milk should be aware that they may react badly to tainted vanilla almond milk. In fact, some consumers with allergies to cows' milk may have a serious or life-threatening reaction to drinking the contaminated almond milk.
The company has stated that the contamination occurred because both almond and cows' milk are processed at the same factory. The company did stress that in general, the almond milk produced by the company is uncontaminated, because the two types of milk are produced on different machinery, keeping them free from contaminants and allergens. Allegedly, the error occurred not because of a problem in the plant's design but because of an employee error.
The recalled vanilla Almond Breeze milk shows a use-by date of Sept. 2, 2018, and the company says it was shipped to the following states:
Alabama Arkansas Connecticut Florida Georgia Iowa Illinois Indiana Kentucky Louisiana Maryland Maine Michigan Minnesota Missouri Mississippi North Carolina Nebraska New Jersey New York Ohio Oklahoma Pennsylvania South Carolina Tennessee Texas Virginia Wisconsin If you purchased the affected vanilla Almond Breeze almond milk in one of the states listed above, you may qualify to join an Almond Breeze class action lawsuit investigation, and you could be entitled to damages.
If you are not sure if your milk was included in the recall and you could be entitled to compensation, check the container. The recalled containers show a use-by date stamp that will look something like these examples:
