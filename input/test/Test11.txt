Thank a nurse for service to our community: Ouisa D.

Nursing staff at hospitals and rehabilitation clinics are some of the public servants who we neglect to thank. Yes, nursing is a public service; the partnership between doctors, administrators and nursing staff is fundamental to the delivery of quality health care services. And at one point or another in our lives, we will all be in the hands of nursing professionals who are the eyes and ears of patient care. There is an incredible shortage of nursing staff in hospitals. In fact, the American Association of Colleges of Nursing predicts that as the number of baby boomers age and the need for specialized health care grows, the current shortage of nurses will intensify.

Auerbach estimated that the U.S. shortage of registered nurses will increase to 340,000 by the year 2020 â€” an increase by three times the current rate over the next two years. Why would anyone want to be a nurse? They work long shifts, often doing double duty providing patient care, comforting family members and fielding doctors' orders. If one is absent, the entire staff must compensate. When that happens, they can't focus on patient care or advocacy â€” the hallmarks of their profession. Burnout is the leading reason for the departure of most nurses from the profession. And enrollment in nursing programs is on the decline.

A survey conducted by the Harvard School of Public Health and the Henry J. Kaiser Family Foundation found that 53 percent of physicians and 65 percent of the public cited the shortage of nurses as a leading cause of medical errors. Overall, 42 percent of the public and more than a third of U.S. doctors reported that they or their family members have experienced medical errors in the course of receiving medical care. Families, pay attention to your loved one's care by nursing staff; while nurses will try to provide for the patient, they can't be everywhere at once. And they are human. It's important to insist upon quality patient care for your ill family member. Don't be afraid to tell the nurses what the patient needs â€” whether it's an undelivered meal, a bath that wasn't given or the timely administration of medication. Don't hesitate to ask questions or do independent research. The nursing administrator on duty will be grateful for the extra set of eyes in the delivery of critical services. When doctors, nurses, patients and family members work together, the work of nursing staff is enhanced. Those are the moments when nursing professionals find great meaning in their work, the moments that nurses feel that they provide a public service. Young people should not be afraid to explore nursing as a career option. Many initiatives address the shortage of RNs and nurse educators through grants, fellowships and loan forgiveness programs. These exist here in El Paso, through El Paso Community College and the University of Texas at El Paso. Perhaps, we need to make some noise. Maybe it's time to begin speaking out to hospital administrations â€” cost-saving measures do not meet the needs of patients. Demand better working conditions for medical support personnel. Insist upon appropriate patient care for a loved one who is hospitalized. Be an advocate for the nurses who care for patients as medical professionals. And, yes, hug a nurse. Thank them for their dedication. And thank them for their service to our community. Ouisa D. Davis is an attorney at law in El Paso.
