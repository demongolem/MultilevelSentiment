Let's talk cigars, says STG share on:
Cigar manufacturer Scandinavian Tobacco Group UK (STG UK) is to roll out a new online platform this autumn to provide retailers with key industry information and advice on how to maximise the cigar opportunity in their stores.
The still-to-go-live trade website, www.stgtrade.co.uk , will be centred around the strapline 'Let's Talk'. It will build on the consumer insights the company's Head of Marketing & Public Affairs Jens Christiansen recently revealed in SLR . These suggested that many retailers are missing out on tobacco sales due to not proactively engaging with customers.
Christiansen said: "Our research findings showed that over half (51%) of retailers aren't offering their customers the all-important guidance they need on which tobacco products to purchase. As one of the leading cigar manufacturers, we recognise we have an important role to play in helping retailers realise this opportunity by educating them on the category and how best to engage with customers."
The website will provide a host of tools designed especially with the trade in mind. These include information on STG UK's brands and products, the top-sellers in each segment, recommended ranging and planograms, as well as category management advice and top tips on how to build customer loyalty, along with retailer testimonials and success stories.
"The relationship between independent retailers and their customers is integral to sales success, especially within the Tobacco category," Christiansen added.
"Taking the time to engage with shoppers and forge a stronger connection by proactively offering advice can really pay off in sales. The average profitability for cigars is double that of cigarettes so it's really worth investing the time and effort in understanding the category and different products available so you can in turn offer well-informed advice to your customers.
"With the launch of our new website, we want to provide retailers with all the tools they need to help them take advantage of this opportunity, so they can successfully grow and enhance their businesses."
STG UK has more plans in the pipeline for 'Let's Talk' to help engage with retailers and recognise the important role they play within their communities. These will be unveiled later in the year
