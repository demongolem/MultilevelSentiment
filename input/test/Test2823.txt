Fax machines; funding mega-rounds; 3nm chips. August 17th, 2018 - By: Jeff Dorsch
Cybersecurity Check Point Software Technologies reports that facsimile machines (yes, people still use them!) can be subject to hacking through vulnerabilities in their communication protocols. The HP Officejet Pro All-in-One fax printers and other fax machines can be compromised with a hacker only knowing a fax number, according to the company. Check Point Research says a design flaw in Android's Sandbox feature enables external data storage to serve as a conduit for cyberattacks . Researcher Slava Makkaveev described these "man-in-the-disk" attacks at the DEF CON event in Las Vegas.

Automotive Tech Bloomberg News took a very close look at Quanergy Systems , the LiDAR sensor startup in Sunnyvale, Calif. Among its findings: Some of its products aren't meeting their specifications, and there seems to be a brain drain of sorts. Co-founder and CEO Louay Eldada told Bloomberg, "People understand we are the real deal. We are the veterans." Meanwhile, Quanergy announced appointing Oprema as the distributor of its QORTEX for Security system in the United Kingdom and Ireland.

Finance Private funding of $100 million or more is commonly known as a mega-round, this analysis notes. Throwing mega-millions at tech startups has lately been popularized by the SoftBank Vision Fund and Chinese investors, among others. There were 273 mega-rounds in 2017, a record bound to be broken this year, which has seen 268 mega-rounds in the first seven months of 2018. Is SoftBank upending the venture capital business? They are not, however, the biggest dispenser of mega-rounds, as Tencent Holdings was behind 31 mega-rounds so far this year, compared with 18 for the SoftBank fund. Tencent this week reported that its profit growth has slowed for the first time in more than 10 years, as Chinese regulators halted sales of its "Monster Hunter: World" game for gory content, while its "PlayerUnknown's Battleground" game is being scrutinized by regulators as the company seeks a license to sell virtual items in the mobile application.

We believe that improved smart electric car technologies, coupled with better experience of car ownership, will drive increased appreciation and adoption of smart electric cars, leading to the fulfillment of our vision of blue skies and a more sustainable future for our planet." Morgan Stanley , Goldman Sachs (Asia) , and J.P Morgan are the leading underwriters for the proposed IPO.
Uber Technologies gave up on developing self-driving trucks, two years after it paid more than $600 million to acquire Otto . Some who were involved in that effort still share a vision of autonomous driving in the trucking industry. Anthony Levandowski, a former Waymo employee who was a founder of Otto, left Uber more than a year ago and is reportedly involved in a stealthy "intelligent driving" startup known as Kache.ai . Don Burnette, another Otto founder, who left Uber in March, still wants to realize the vision of self-driving trucks with his new startup, Kodiak Robotics , which received $40 million in Series A funding led by Battery Ventures .
