Federal Labor has confirmed a pledge to introduce a legal definition of casual employment, following a landmark Federal Court decision to grant a casual truck driver annual leave.
Tony Maher, national president of the Construction, Forestry, Mining, Maritime and Energy Union, supported Labor's plan to introduce a definition of casual employment in the Fair Work Act which was consistent with the Workpac v Skene decision and the common law definition of intermittent work.
Bill Shorten has pledged there will be no such thing as a permanent casual under a future Labor government.

A spokesman for Federal Labor MP Tanya Plibersek said Labor is clear it will "call time" on the exploitation of so-called 'permanent casuals'.
"In contrast, Malcolm Turnbull has denied the problem exists and has done nothing about it," he said. "Labor is carefully working through the Federal Court's decision and considering the implications."

"Once you've been in that job for a period of time, you are a permanent worker," he said.
The landmark ruling that has granted a casual worker annual leave entitlements sparked warnings from unions and employer groups that a clearer definition of casual employment is needed.
A spokesman for Workplace Minister Craig Laundy said he was "reviewing the decision carefully, including any broader implications".

Under the Fair Work Act national employment standards, a casual employee is not entitled to annual leave which permanent employees receive. The Act does not provide a definition of a casual employee.
Steve Knott, the Australian Mines and Metals Association said that an employee can seek and be awarded annual leave entitlements after knowingly accepting a higher rate of pay rate due to being casual, "massively fails the pub test," said Steve Knott, AMMA chief executive.
"Casual employees in Australia get paid extra loading in lieu of other entitlements including annual leave. This is widely understood and accepted by all Australians, from teenagers getting their first job at Coles or McDonalds to casual mining operators taking home some of the best hourly pay rates in the country."
"That a 68-page decision of the Full Federal Court can turn a simple concept like this on its head, shows how absurdly complex Australia's workplace relations legislative environment has become.
