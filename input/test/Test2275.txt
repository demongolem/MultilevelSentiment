Young marketers crave job security over edgy smaller brands By John Glenday - 17 August 2018 09:59am Young marketers crave job security over edgy brands
A new survey designed to elicit the opinions of the next generation of marketers has found that job security trumps the appeal of working for a 'cutting edge' brand when it comes to finding employment.
The Chartered Institute of Marketing quizzed 500 young people aged between 17 and 19 who had just finished school or college to establish their views, with four in 10 of those asked expressing interest in a future marketing career.
When it comes to future roles however the majority (64%) expressed a preference for signing up to a larger corporate-style company and the accompanying job security â€“ with far fewer willing to chance their arm with a start-up (11%), smaller businesses (12%) or firms dedicated towards social good (6%).
In fact a high salary was viewed by 44% as more important than a career which helps others, with just 33% telling their interrogators that they prioritised more altruistic aims. Am aversion to risk was also apparent with 60% preferring to work with businesses that had a track record of success, with just 35% preferring a business which had still to break out of the 'cutting edge'.
CIM CEO Chris Daly said: "We shouldn't be surprised, in the current economic climate, that young people are prioritising job security in big established firms. These young people have grown up during an extended economic downturn, so it may be that the stability and job security of large successful firms is what appeals to them most."
The findings come in stark contrast to surveys of Millenials , who are believed to prioritise more nebulous qualities beyond salary and stability
