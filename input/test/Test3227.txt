Emerging-market equities are threatening to drop into bear-market territory, turning one of 2017's strongest equity categories into one of the weakest of 2018.
The MSCI Emerging Markets index has tumbled 19.8% from a peak in January. That drop puts it a hair under the 20% threshold that is generally considered to represent a bear market.
There have been several catalysts for the decline , including the U.S. dollar's 4.7% year-to-date gain. A stronger dollar is a headwind for many EM companies that borrow in the greenback and then have higher costs of paying that back as it strengthens. Friction between the United States and its major trading partners, particularly China, have also weighed on sentiment around emerging markets.
Recently, concerns about Turkey have been key. The country's currency fell to an all-time low against the dollar and its stock market fell sharply. Turkey is under pressure because of high inflation, large levels of debt and a president at odds with the country's central bank. While the Turkish lira has shown some signs of stabilizing lately, having jumped about 10% against the dollar this week, investors continue to fret over the prospect of the country's problems spilling out into other regions.

"Although we think EM contagion fears may be overdone, there has clearly been some fundamental deterioration in the space," wrote John Lynch, chief investment strategist for LPL Financial. He noted that earnings expectations for emerging-market stocks have been dropping, while forecasts for U.S. stocks have been trending higher.

"Despite the Turkey situation, EM broadly has many solid fundamentals, including economic growth, favorable demographics, and attractive valuations. We look for an eventual compromise on trade, suggesting the potential for a pivot in EM performance." He added that while the sector would likely remain volatile "as these clouds take time to clear," he thought that "investors who have maintained some exposure to EM will be glad they did."
Richard Turnill, BlackRock's global chief investment strategist, wrote that emerging-market equity valuations "have become disconnected from strong fundamentals, we believe, and offer attractive compensation for risk."
Over the past month, investors have poured $2.4 billion into exchange-traded funds that track the region, making them the second-most popular ETF category over the period, according to FactSet. The group with the highest inflows was large-capitalization U.S. stocks, the biggest ETF category overall, with $742.6 billion in assets, compared with the $154 billion in EM equities.
The iShares Core MSCI Emerging Markets ETF IEMG, +0.66% has received the bulk of those inflows, with some $2.2 billion entering the fund over the past month. The largest EM equity ETF, the Vanguard FTSE Emerging Markets ETF VWO, +0.71% has only seen slight inflows over the past month.
Emerging-market stocks have shed 10.7% over the past three months, and they are on track for a 3.8% decline for the week, per FactSet data. That would represent the index's third straight weekly drop as well as its steepest weekly decline since March. The declines have taken the index to its lowest level in about a year.
To compare, the S&P 500 SPX, +0.79% is up 6.3% thus far this year, and it is up 4.4% over the past three months.
