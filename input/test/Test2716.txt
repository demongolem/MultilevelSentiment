Going Green To promote environmental awareness and waste reduction, a pilot on-site food container lending service has been launched at the Food Expo this year to reduce the use of disposable plastic utensils. Visitors can borrow a reusable food container with wooden utensils at a deposit of HK$20 in cash (at the entrance of Hall 1E), and return the used food container and reclaim the deposit when leaving the fairground (at Hall 1A and 3E Concourses). Available while stocks last, the service is run jointly by the HKTDC, NWS Holdings Limited and social enterprise BottLess, with the wooden utensils sponsored by Hong Kong Convention and Exhibition Centre (Management) Limited. To encourage visitors and exhibitors to reduce waste, the HKTDC continues to cooperate with Food For Good and Food Angel to collect and recycle packaged edible food and food waste at the fairground, and invite exhibitors to donate food to needy communities after the fair. The HKTDC also encourages exhibitors and visitors to follow green tips such as sorting recyclable waste into recycle bins placed at the fairground. Visitors are encouraged to bring their own utensils, food boxes, water bottles and shopping bags. Fair Website
