A 3D installation of Earth, made up of thousands of answers to the question "How do you stay sane in a world that isn't?", has been constructed to mark the publication of Matt Haig's latest book Notes on a Nervous Planet (Canongate).
Since publication in early July, Haig has been touring up and down the country, attending more than 15 events and speaking to over 4,000 people, to promote the book.
To involve fans in the marketing stunt, after each event, Canongate had been handing out circular pieces of green and blue card with the question - "How do you stay sane in a world that isn't?"
Fans wrote down their tips on the papers which then formed part of a giant 3D installation in the shape of a planet.
Canongate collaborated with Jack Arts on the project, which was unveiled this week on Kingsland Road in London
