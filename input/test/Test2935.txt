Food delivery company Foodora has gone into voluntary administration in a move it says will put legal action against it on hold.
Foodora Australia, which is fighting a landmark test case on the rights of workers, said voluntary administration would give it "essential breathing space", including a suspension of claims against it.
Foodora has announced it is going into voluntary administration in Australia.

However, the company faced "significant external challenges", which had impeded its ability to implement a solvent wind-down.
"The voluntary administration process offers the company essential breathing space, including a statutory moratorium on claims against the company, with a view to ensuring that the affairs of Foodora are administered in a way which results in a better return for creditors of Foodora than would result from its immediate liquidation," the company said.
"To the best of its knowledge, all payments due to Foodora's creditors, in particular, its employees, partner restaurants and contract riders, have been met."
Advertisement The decision earlier this month to leave Australia and Friday's move into administration comes as the company fights a test case in the Fair Work Commission launched by the Transport Workers Union on behalf of former Foodora delivery rider Josh Klooger.
The case could help set a precedent for whether food delivery riders are really employees entitled to legal minimum rates of pay, conditions and protections against unfair dismissal under the Fair Work Act.
Josh Klooger is claiming he was unfairly dismissed as a food delivery rider in the Fair Work Commission.

Foodora on Friday said the litigation would be "stayed" in accordance with section 440D of the Corporations Act, which says court action against a company cannot proceeded without the administrator's written consent or leave from the court.
Simon Cathro and Ivan Glavas of Worrells Solvency and Forensic Accountants have been appointed administrators, effective immediately.
Loading Creditors will be updated on the company's financial affairs at a meeting held after August 29.
The company has been running a food delivery service in Sydney, Melbourne and Brisbane since May 2015.
Earlier this month, Foodora's parent company, Delivery Hero, announced its intention to exit four countries, including Australia, to "consolidate and focus on leadership positions in other markets".
It said it wanted to acknowledge the support of its employees, partner restaurants and contract riders over the past three years.
The Transport Workers' Union has criticised the Federal Government over "inaction" after legal cases against Foodora were stayed when the food delivery company today appointed an administrator.
"The move means a landmark unfair dismissal case taken by former Foodora delivery rider Josh Klooger has been halted, leaving him and thousands of riders without the redress they deserve," the TWU said. "The Federal Government is allowing wage theft to occur by a refusing to regulate and hold these companies to account."
The Fair Work Ombudsman has also launched legal action in the Federal Court that relates to two bicycle delivery riders who delivered food and drinks to customers in Melbourne and a delivery driver who delivered food and drinks by car to customers in Sydney.
The ombudsman alleges Foodora misrepresented the three workers as independent contractors when they were in fact employees.
A spokeswoman for ombudsman said it had learnt in the media on Friday that Foodora had appointed an administrator. "We are considering this development and its impact on our matter before the court," a spokeswoman said.
