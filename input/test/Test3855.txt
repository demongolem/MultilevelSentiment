Ose Anenih, the son of ex-PDP Chairman of the Board of Trustees, Tony Anenih, took to Twitter to defend himself against trolls
The PDP member was being tackled by Nigerians on Twitter who were bemused that he would talk about anti-corruption when his father is a prominent member of a party well known for it.
Recall that Tony Anenih was accused of receiving N260 million from ex-National Security Adviser, Sambo Dasuki, who is currently in detention over the $2.1 billion arms scandal.
Anenih came out with a robust response to his trolls, showing that he has the 'cojones' to stand up to the very worst Twitter has to offer.
Read his response below
Dear TL and my 4,920 followers, I think I need to (one again) declare who I am and what I represent, so there's no confusion. 1. I am Chief Tony Anenih's son. Not his nephew, or distant relative. I wasn't adopted. Na my papa. 2. I am a PDP member. I am partisan.
3. I have very strong opinions, and I have no bones about sharing them. 4. I'm a husband, father, and friend. If you're not my wife, child, or friend, you can fuck off. 5. I swear a lot, especially on Twitter. (See 4. Above).

6. I am no anti-corruption advocate. I think man tends towards decay, and needs systems and protocols to curb this descent into anarchy. 7. I'm pragmatic. It's why although I stan for Moghalu I won't be voting for him, because it would be one less vote cast against Buhari.
8. I'm not a coward. I don't do subs. My father, Chief Tony Anenih, the Iyasele of Esanland, raised lions not sniveling cockroaches. My @ button isn't broken @ Mr_JAGs @ fredliner009 9. I believe in personal responsibility. I'm not Jesus; I will not carry your cross.
10. I'm the greatest advocate of free speech, without limitation or censor. So if you expect me to be 'quiet' b/cos you hold an unsavory opinion about my father, you miss road. 11. Finally, you need to know I'm also a totally shameless troll. One of the best that ever liveth.
At this point I'll be taking questions from the audience. Thank you. Dear TL and my 4,920 followers, I think I need to (one again) declare who I am and what I represent, so there's no confusion.
