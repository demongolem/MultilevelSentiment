Reuters reported yesterday that internet shopping giant Amazon is rumoured to be thinking of launching its own insurance comparison web-site. The aim is not only to compete with the likes of Moneysupermarket and confused.com, but to leverage the personal data collected. It would probably start with extensions to manufacturer warranties.
UK July retail sales data published yesterday saw the expected increase in food and drink consumption thanks to football's World Cup and the warm weather. Overall sales on the month increased by 0.7 per cent, reversing June's 0.5 per cent slump; non-food items rose by just 0.3 per cent and footfall on the high street fell.
DAX 30
A pathetic attempt at a bounce yesterday has kept the MACD steadily bearish. A weekly close below 12000 should add downside momentum until month-end.
SHORT TERM TRADER: Short at 12635; stop above 12930. Target 12200
