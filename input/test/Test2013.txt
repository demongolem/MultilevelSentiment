Editor's Notes: According to notorious leaker @py_rates, adidas is planning to bring back its hugely popular Ultra Boost 1.0 in several OG colorways.
One of the colorways is said to be the above-pictured "Cream" Ultra Boost, which was reselling for insane amounts at the time of release and is sitting at about $400 on StockX currently. Two other Ultra Boost 1.0 models that are rumored to return are the navy and white pairs with multicolored toes.
Upon its introduction, adidas' Ultra Boost became many sneakerhead's go-to shoe thanks to BOOST technology's perceived comfort and the fact that Kanye West was often seen wearing various colorways in the earlier days of his adidas affiliation.

The silhouette is now in its fourth version, with the Primeknit upper being updated each time. The reason the 1.0 is held in such high regard is that many collectors find the Primeknit pattern on the original Ultra Boost to be more aesthetically pleasing than that of the versions that came after it.

So far, all we have to go on are the rumors courtesy of leak accounts. While these accounts are often right in their predictions, they can just as often be wrong or mix up details.
