Kavanaugh, President Trumpâ€™s Supreme Court nominee, was among the lawyers investigating Mr. Clinton, and it was his nomination that led to the release of the report. But Judge Kavanaugh, who now sits on the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, was not named in it.<br />American Oversight, a liberal watchdog group, went to court last week seeking the report, saying that â€œJudge Kavanaughâ€™s potential involvementâ€� in misconduct â€œis a matter of great public importance and current national debate.â€�<br />Raj Shah, a White House spokesman, said on Thursday that the request had reflected liberal desperation in opposing Judge Kavanaughâ€™s nomination. â€œThis report refutes the latest false accusation by Senate Democrats and fully exonerates Judge Kavanaugh,â€� he said.<br />Austin Evers, the executive director of American Oversight, said that the report examined only some disclosures and that Judge Kavanaughâ€™s work on the investigation warrants further scrutiny. â€œThat it took litigation by an outside watchdog to bring this report to light speaks volumes about the rush to confirm Judge Kavanaugh without fully vetting his record,â€� he said.<br />The report was prepared by a special master appointed in 1998 by Judge<br />Norma Holloway Johnson<br />of the Federal District Court in Washington in response to complaints that Ken Starr, the independent counsel investigating Mr. Clinton, had violated the law by leaking grand jury materials.<br />The special master, Judge John W. Kern III of the District of Columbia Court of Appeals, a local court, wrote that he had received sworn statements denying wrongdoing from all 141 people who worked in Mr. Starrâ€™s office in 1998, which would have included Judge Kavanaugh.<br />In his 62-page report, Judge Kern said Mr. Starrâ€™s office had faced a deluge of inquiries from reporters after news of Mr. Clintonâ€™s relationship with the intern, Monica Lewinsky, was posted on The Drudge Report. â€œThe mainstream media shortly picked up the story,â€� Judge Kern wrote, â€œand the press frenzy was on.â€�<br />The office, he wrote, â€œwas overwhelmed by, and unprepared for, the onslaught.â€� Its responses, he said, â€œwere at times ad hoc, clumsy, unwise and inconsistent withâ€� its own policies. In particular, Judge Kern questioned the officeâ€™s practice of talking with reporters off the record.<br />But his examination of 24 press reports found that Mr. Starrâ€™s office had not been shown to have committed wrongdoing in connection with any of them. Much of the information in the reports probably came from sources outside Mr. Starrâ€™s office, Judge Kern wrote; much of it was not covered by grand jury secrecy; and some was inaccurate.<br />Judge Kern died in January, and Judge Johnson in 2011.<br />The name of one prosecutor criticized by Judge Kern was redacted from the report. The Justice Department had<br />, saying it was needed â€œto protect the privacy of one individual discussed in the report â€” an individual who is not Judge Brett Kavanaugh.â€�<br />Follow Adam Liptak on Twitter:<br /
