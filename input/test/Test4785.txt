Duration : 03:13 Description: Ravi Shastri speaks to the press ahead of the 3rd England vs India Test Match at Trent Bridge. With India 2-0 down, Shastri called the players to "Believe in yourself" and turn around the matches in style. He further said that this Indian team is as good as it gets. If they are able to perform to their potential, they can beat any team in the world. The batsmen need to apply themselves better to the conditions. Talking about the 2nd Test match he said looking in hindsight it was an error to go with 2 spinners. Given the amount of rain they got in the 5 days, an extra pacer would have been handy to trouble the English batsmen. About Virat Kohli's back injury he said that the skipper is moving much better in the practice sessions and he will most likely take the field at Trent Bridge. Further, he avoided revealing the team plans for the 3rd Test match. Asked about whether Rishabh Pant will make his Test debut he said that for that you have to wait till the toss and see for yourself.
