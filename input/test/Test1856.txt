They get injured on grass pitches.<br />"For Jamie, we wish him a speedy and full recovery and hope he is back playing as soon as possible."<br />'Plastic pitches should not be allowed' - Gerrard<br />Hamilton Academical and Livingston are the other top-flight clubs with artificial surfaces, which are also common in the Scottish Professional Football League's other divisions.<br />"For Kilmarnock, the initial decision to put down that pitch was financial and it has benefited the club financially because it's in a much more secure financial footing than it was 10 years ago, when it almost went bankrupt," Clarke said.<br />"We can't lift the plastic pitch this year, so there's no point getting into a discussion about it because it can't come up - it's there for the season.<br />"We have to play on it and train on it, and that's what we'll do.<br />"I think there's a mechanism in place if clubs don't want plastic pitches they can vote them out, but I would suggest they are not going to do that because they have allowed Livingston to put a plastic pitch down this year, Hamilton have just relayed a plastic pitch.<br />"And, don't forget, plastic pitches are used all over the world."<br /
