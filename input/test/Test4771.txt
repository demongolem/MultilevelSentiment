NSW Multicultural Affairs Minister Ray Williams has been accused of politically interfering in a water investigation, after an independent report revealed he repeatedly lobbied his own government for one of his constituents to be given a free water licence and favourable treatment over an illegal dam.
Mr Williams wrote six letters to the Minister for Water between 2014 and 2017 on behalf on a constituent, Garry Bugeja, who was being investigated by water compliance officers over an illegal dam on his property at Glossodia in north-west Sydney.
The details of Mr Williams' level of intervention into the matter - which included attending a site visit on Mr Bugeja's property with senior water officials - are contained in an Ombudsman's report into water compliance, tabled in NSW Parliament on Friday.

In a 2015 letter to Water Minister Niall Blair, Mr Williams accused the Office of Water of making a "false claim" that the dam had been moved and increased in size.
Advertisement "The local MP demanded that the Minister review the matter and asked that 'no further costs, intimidation and bullying' be undertaken by DPI Water toward the property owner's family and that a free water licence be given to the property owner," the report said.
However, the Ombudsman's report stated that DPI Water became "concerned by inconsistencies between the representations in the letter and evidence obtained during site visits."
In another letter, Mr Williams argued that a requirement that Mr Bugeja submit a retrospective development application for the dam was "grossly unfair and intimidating to [the property owner] and his family".
The report concluded that departmental staff "initially tried to resolve this case in the public interest, free from political interests" but that the final outcome "appeared to be influenced by considerations other than the legislative framework and DPI Water policy."
It also labelled as "questionable" the decision by staff not to enforce compliance measures against Mr Bugeja on the basis that "consultations/negotiations with the property owner and the local MP were ongoing".
Opposition water spokesman Chris Minns said Mr Williams' conduct was "evidence that he politically interfered in an investigation into water rorts that resulted in an outcome that was not in the public interest."
" At a time of severe drought the public can have no confidence in the enforcement and compliance of water in NSW," Mr Minns said.
Three of the letters sent by Mr Williams to Mr Blair, as well as the site visit in February 2016, occurred when Mr Williams was no longer Mr Bugeja's local MP.
At the 2015 election, Mr Williams swapped his Hawkesbury electorate for the seat of Castle Hill, in a negotiated trade with the then-finance minister Dominic Perrottet.
Mr Williams did not respond to the Herald 's questions, with his office saying he would not be commenting on the matter.
The report was also critical of the proposal by department staff, and subsequently taken up by Mr Bugeja, that he legitimise the dam by converting it into a "nutrient control pond", for which he would not need to buy a water licence.
"The approaches developed by DPI Water and WaterNSW gave the property owner special treatment in a way that was not consistent with the Water Management Act," the report said.
It labelled the outcome as "inequitable or generally not in the public interest" and one which resulted in an "unfair gain or advantage to an individual."
"The property owner benefited from constructing an unauthorised dam allowing him to store and use more water on his property without approval than he would otherwise be entitled to. He was also not required to purchase a water allocation which had an estimated value of between $10,000 and $20,000," the report said.
It also concluded there was a need for "clear guidelines on the role of MPs, Ministerial staff and public servants in cases where MPs are advocating for their constituents."
Mr Blair, via a spokeswoman, said the government's establishment of the independent Natural Resources Access Regulator in 2017 "seeks to overcome many of the recommendations made by the Ombudsman.
