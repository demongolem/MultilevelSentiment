The first six months for him here is good and he was doing goals last year and for that I am sure he is going to do the same this time.'<br />Aubameyang has been preferred to fellow striker Alexandre Lacazette in Emery's opening two games, the Frenchman coming off the bench in the losses to Manchester City and Chelsea.<br />But, with West Ham the visitors to the Emirates Stadium on Saturday, Emery does not believe it is time to send out the duo as a strike partnership.<br />'At the moment, no,' he replied when asked if he could be tempted to play a front two against the Hammers.<br />'At the moment, I think we need to have the control with the possession, with the positioning on the pitch, with more players inside.<br />'After this possession, to do the attacking moments and defending moments with this balance.'<br />Arsenal are still seeking their first points of the year, having lost their opening two games<br />RELATED ARTICLES<br /
