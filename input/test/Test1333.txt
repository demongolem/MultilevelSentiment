smart city medical ecosystem.<br />Ping An of China's smart city sand table<br />OCT intelligent ocular fundus disease diagnosis system jointly developed by Ping An Medical Technology and US-based Optovue<br />Ping An Technology showcases five smart medical solutions<br />Intelligent eye screening platform<br />Diseases of the ocular fundus can be easily detected and diagnosed early with AI. At the exhibition, Ping An Medical Technology released for the first time an OCT intelligent diagnostic system for ocular fundus diseases jointly developed with US-based Optovue. The system is the industry's first AI image screening system that seamlessly combines OCT fundus examination and AI lesion screening. From OCT examination to patient scan code to obtain an intelligent screening report, the entire process can be completed in three minutes. Based on<br />Ping An's<br />deep learning technology, the intelligent eye screening platform can study and<br />analyze thousands of<br />data points collected during the course of the examination of the fundus, to screen for diabetic retinopathy and age-related macular degeneration (AMD). At present, the platform has an accuracy rate for recognizing diabetic retinopathy of 98.5%, and its AMD model can automatically locate the drusen (yellow deposits under the retina) and conduct relevant quantitative analysis. The platform was built based on Ping An Technology's deep knowledge in the field of computer vision, and won a world first in EX (hard exudates) image segmentation, world second in HE (bleeding) segmentation and world third in MA (microaneurysm) segmentation task at the Indian Diabetic Retinopathy Image Dataset (IDRiD) fundus analysis competition held by ISBI, an international conference.<br />Intelligent imaging quality control platform<br />Based on the AI algorithms, the platform identifies the lesions automatically and smartly assists in the diagnosis according to the images displayed in a standard medical image format. In addition, the system is able to control the quality of the imaging diagnosis using AI technology with the aim of reducing the number of missed imaging-based diagnoses and improving the usefulness of imaging for clinical diagnosis as well as productivity at hospitals. After the hospital technician uploads the images, quality control experts use the online image quality control assessment functionality to deliver final rating results. The advantages of the platform include examining the images using advanced AI technology and clearly displaying the conditions of lesions. The platform provides physicians with real-time visibility of data on quality control results and the comparisons between quality and quantity of the images examined in terms of the device, location of the lesions, profile of the patient and timestamp.<br />Intelligent imaging diagnostic system<br />Early this year, Ping An Technology broke world records for the detection of lung nodules and reduction in the number of false positives with accuracy rates of 95.1% and 96.8% respectively, placing the firm in the leadership position in terms of these two indexes which are part of the Lung Nodule Analysis (LUNA) assessment standard, the internationally accepted standard within the medical imaging field. By leveraging the advanced technology, the company's intelligent medical imaging screening system can complete the AI-based interpretation of CT scans and intelligent reporting within one minute. Ping An Technology has developed medical imaging models targeting over 30 types of diseases, 200 million patients and 600 million people identified as in need of disease screening. The system plays a key role in local hospitals. Within one week of deploying the system at a county-level hospital, over 60 patients were detected with lung nodules and one patient was detected with suspicious lung nodules and immediately transferred to a superior Grade III, Class A hospital due to the severity of the finding.<br />Intelligent disease risk prediction system<br />Built on big data, AI and machine learning technology, the intelligent disease risk prediction system mines the data that can identify disease risk factors from a large number of characteristics. The system, which covers prediction models for 30 chronic diseases including cardio-cerebrovascular diseases, diabetes mellitus and respiratory diseases as well as their complications, automatically screens for disease risk factors from more than 3.5 million physical examinations and electronic medical records and builds intelligent disease prediction models using a machine learning method.<br />Taking cardio-cerebrovascular diseases as an example, it only takes approximately five minutes to generate prediction results for five main cardio-cerebrovascular diseases including coronary heart disease, stroke, atrial fibrillation, heart failure and myocardial infarction. Developed in collaboration with several medical authorities including the Chongqing Center for Disease Control and Prevention and the Health and Family Planning Commission of Shenzhen Municipality, the system has achieved success in the prediction of infectious diseases and risk factor screening of chronic diseases. It can predict the incidence of infectious diseases one week in advance of existing methods, with an over 86 percent accuracy rate for influenza and hand-foot-and-mouth disease and an over 90 percent accuracy rate during peak periods of occurrence.<br />Intelligent medical assistant<br />The intelligent medical assistant is a chat robot based on natural language processing (NLP) technology. Rooted in medical knowledge and covering pre- and post-diagnosis medical scenarios, the assistant comes equipped with four main functions: triage, guidance, patient Q&amp;A and follow-up. The algorithms of the triage model support the identification of more than 2,000 symptoms and the diagnosis of 500 diseases including 35 common diseases, with the accuracy rate for the top most common five answers reaching 95 percent. In terms of patient Q&amp;A, a diabetes Q&amp;A model is now available and has compiled over 800 frequently asked questions covering 90 key categories from more than 40 million questions, with an 90.1 percent accuracy rate, 20 percent higher than data-trained open AI platforms for general purposes.<br />The five flagship solutions provided by Ping An Medical Technology have all seen application in real life. The company has established partnerships with nearly 100 Chinese healthcare organizations, including Fudan University Shanghai Cancer Center and the Fourth People's Hospital of Datong, among several other Grade-III, Class-A hospitals, as well as the people's hospitals of Longli county,<br />Guizhou<br />province and Xinhuang Dong Autonomous County,<br />Hunan<br />province, in addition to several other Grade-II and local medical organizations.<br />Ping An Medical Technology was formerly known as Ping An Technology Smart Medical Center.
