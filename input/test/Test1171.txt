Even when Facebook loses, it still wins.
Price spikes are scaring away some advertisers from Instagram Stories and leading them to diversify to â€¦ Facebook Stories, which are cheaper.
Facebook news feed ad dollars are slowly following user engagement over to Instagram, according to four ad executives interviewed for this article. It's relying on buzz around its vertical video format Instagram Stories to speed up the transition as advertisers have been slow to buy into Facebook's pitch. For example, the percentage of Instagram spend the clients for advertising automation platform Smartly.io has spent on ads in Stories in April accounted for just 16 percent of its total spend on the platform last month.
"We're seeing larger clients shift their Facebook budget slowly across into Instagram as that's where target audiences' eyeballs are moving," the head of trading at one of the holding groups said on condition of anonymity. "Clients have pulled advertising from Facebook's news feed due to low viewability. But as more ad investment moves into Instagram, it will increase cost per thousand impressions as well as cost per clicks. Larger clients seem willing to make that sacrifice."
Smaller advertisers, who were some of the earliest adopters of Instagram Stories, are worried those ads are about to get pricey.
Some companies like flight-booking app Hopper are looking at Facebook Stories as a cheaper alternative. Advertisers can only buy what limited ads there are in Facebook Stories when they either buy ads in Instagram Stories or in the news feed, which Hopper has been doing in recent weeks. Currently, around 40 percent of its ad budget is spent on Instagram Stories, while another 10 percent is spent on Snapchat. Facebook Stories is a small but growing amount of that outlay, said the app's head of user acquisition, Simon Lejeune.
"Ads in Instagram Stories were cheaper and more efficient than the other placement, but we're in the phase where the price is getting more expensive as more advertisers are auctioning for impressions," said Lejeune. "We started looking at Facebook Stories as a result to see whether it would be cheaper and in some ways more efficient as a media buy when there aren't as many advertisers there."
It's standard to see lower CPMs for any new ad placement with limited availability or adoption because fewer advertisers are competing for the space. Instagram Stories has around 400 million daily active users, according to Facebook, while Facebook Stories has around 150 million â€” 40 million fewer than those on Snapchat.
