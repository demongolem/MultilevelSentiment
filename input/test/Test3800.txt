A new study , published in the journal Nature Communications , has demonstrated that sleep-deprived individuals feel lonelier and less inclined to engage with others. Worse still, that alienating vibe makes sleep-deprived people more socially unattractive to others. Moreover, even well-rested people feel lonely after just a brief encounter with a sleep-deprived person, triggering a viral contagion of social isolation. This study is the first to show a two-way relationship between sleep loss and becoming socially isolated. Poor sleep triggers loneliness and social rejection. Image credit: Patrica J. Joslin.
"We humans are a social species. Yet sleep deprivation can turn us into social lepers," said University of California, Berkeley's Professor Matthew Walker , co-author of the study.
To gauge the social effects of poor sleep, Professor Walker and his colleague, Dr. Eti Ben-Simon of the University of California, Berkeley, conducted a series of intricate experiments using such tools as fMRI brain imaging, standardized loneliness measures, videotaped simulations and surveys via Amazon's Mechanical Turk online marketplace.
First, the duo tested the social and neural responses of 18 healthy young adults following a normal night's sleep and a sleepless night.
The participants viewed video clips of individuals with neutral expressions walking toward them. When the person on the video got too close, they pushed a button to stop the video, which recorded how close they allowed the person to get.
As predicted, sleep-deprived participants kept the approaching person at a significantly greater distance away â€” between 18 and 60% further back â€” than when they had been well-rested.
Participants also had their brains scanned as they watched the videos of individuals approaching them.
In sleep-deprived brains, the scientists found heightened activity in a neural circuit known as the 'near space network,' which is activated when the brain perceives potential incoming human threats.
In contrast, another circuit of the brain that encourages social interaction, called the 'theory of mind' network, was shut down by sleep deprivation, worsening the problem.
For the online section of the study, more than 1,000 observers recruited via Amazon's Mechanical Turk marketplace viewed videotapes of study participants discussing commonplace opinions and activities.
The observers were unaware that the subjects had been deprived of sleep and rated each of them based on how lonely they appeared, and whether they would want to interact socially with them. Time and again, they rated study participants in the sleep-deprived state as lonelier and less socially desirable.
To test whether sleep-loss-induced alienation is contagious, the researchers asked observers to rate their own levels of loneliness after watching videos of study participants. They were surprised to find that otherwise healthy observers felt alienated after viewing just a 60-second clip of a lonely person.
Finally, they looked at whether just one night of good or bad sleep could influence one's sense of loneliness the next day. Each person's state of loneliness was tracked via a standardized survey that asked such questions as, "How often do you feel isolated from others" and "Do you feel you don't have anyone to talk to?"
Notably, the scientists found that the amount of sleep a person got from one night to the next accurately predicted how lonely and unsociable they would feel from one day to the next.
"This all bodes well if you sleep the necessary seven to nine hours a night, but not so well if you continue to short-change your sleep," Professor Walker said.
"On a positive note, just one night of good sleep makes you feel more outgoing and socially confident, and furthermore, will attract others to you."
"It's perhaps no coincidence that the past few decades have seen a marked increase in loneliness and an equally dramatic decrease in sleep duration. Without sufficient sleep we become a social turn-off, and loneliness soon kicks in," Dr. Ben-Simon said
