Forks Supervisors table Knollwood plans one more month By: Posted: August 17, 2018 01:31 AM EDT Updated: August 17, 2018 05:42 AM EDT 69 News 69 News
EASTON, Pa. - Time is running out for the Forks Township Board of Supervisors to decide on the fate of a proposed 219-unit housing development it has been entertaining for nearly the past five years.
The supervisors decided by a 3-2 vote Thursday to table the approval of a preliminary plan for PA Venture Capital's Knollwood Estates Phase II, to be located south of Kesslerville Road in the township, to their September meeting.
Supervisors Ed Moore and John O'Neil voted to grant conditional preliminary approval provided all plan details are fulfilled in the short term and the developer establishes a homeowners association by declaration.
However, Supervisors Erik Chuss, Bob Martyak and Bob Egolf decided the latest developer plan modification, that raised the number of homes from 214 to 219, and concerns over possible future flooding and sinkhole problems were reasons enough to ask for more time to consider the matter.
Moore said it would only be fair to offer preliminary approval since developer Dave Hart has dropped any previous waiver requests and fulfilled all other township ordinance and engineering requirements including making provisions for storm water removal by constructing drainage ditches.
"Everything's been satisfied," Moore pointed out.
Considering recent area flooding, Martyak who also did not want to offer preliminary approval until all plan details were addressed completely, asked for specific water flow rates and soil test results for the area.
"This is as close as we've ever built near to a floodplain," he remarked.
Forks Farm resident Donna Petterson said the 12 twin homes to be built adjacent to Wagon Wheel Road will have swimming pools in their backyards following the next rainstorm.
She supported the board tabling the matter since the plan has changed each time the developer has come before the board.
"The plan changes home sizes each and every time. It's a new plan every time," she noted.
She offered the supervisors phone video as evidence of heavy flooding in the area after the recent rains.
Chuss feared past mistakes which occurred due to incomplete plans were regrettable.
"I just don't see what further changes can be made," Moore said.
The board will be required to approve or deny Knollwood at its Sept. 20 meeting. Continue Reading All rights reserved. This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten or redistributed.
