No longer would we have to drive personal vehicles or even walk the "last mile" from transit stops to our final destinationsâ€Šâ€”â€Špods piloted by computers would whisk us wherever we wanted to go at minimal cost. The most ambitious technologists even claimed that transit was outdatedâ€Šâ€”â€Šit was dirty, scary , and didn't get you to your final destinationâ€Šâ€”â€Šbut autonomous vehicles would would make "individualized" transportation accessible to allâ€Šâ€”â€Šspace limitations of dense urban cores be damned! Can you seriously see us trying to cram all the people on the sidewalks of New York City, or almost any major city around the world, into autonomous pods without creating the worst gridlock we've ever seen? It's a hilarious proposal that some technologists really believe inâ€Šâ€”â€Šremember that Elon Musk wants to build a ton of tunnels below Los Angeles for this exact reason. Of course, autonomous vehicles will not dominate the streets of the future. The blind fantasies of tech boosters whose visions are limited by their elite lifestyles and ignorant belief that their knowledge can translate to any field they choose are finally being revealed for being based on a technical foundation that may never achieve the capabilities they promised. And while the reality of being sold a lie leaves some discouraged, a much more exciting proposition for the future of mobility is emerging. Instead of streets that are hostile to anyone not in a metal box weighing a ton or two, the prospect of reclaiming streets for peopleâ€Šâ€”â€Šnot carsâ€Šâ€”â€Šcould be within reach. Waking up to autonomous limitations It's hard to understate the significance of the impact that the pedestrian death in Tempe, Arizona had on the industry in the months after March 2018. Ambitious visions were replaced with cautious statements about the capabilities and prospects for autonomous vehicles, and for once it seemed that industry leaders were coming to terms with the realities of the technology that they'd lost touch with after several years of building hype. Counter to previous industry claims, there's no reliable data backing the notion that autonomous vehicles are safer than human drivers, and we're still far from having the necessary data to derive such statistics . Indeed, it's even possible that by ignoring the technology's limitations, companies have placed autonomous vehicles in situations they weren't equipped to handle, making them far more dangerous than if they took a more cautious approach. Some of the industry's biggest boosters are even starting to admit that their imagined futures where autonomous vehicles dominate the streets wouldn't simply rely on achieving a level of artificial intelligence that could take a lot longer to develop than they initially thoughtâ€Šâ€”â€Špossibly several decadesâ€Šâ€”â€Šbut will also require pedestrians to change their behavior to accomodate AI drivers. Andrew Ng, a former director of Google Brain and Baidu executive, told The Verge that instead of designing AI that can deal with edge cases, "we should partner with the government to ask people to be lawful and considerate. Safety isn't just about the quality of the AI technology." Or, as Verge writer Russell Brandom put it, the boosters of autonomous driving want to "make roads safe for the cars instead of the other way around"â€Šâ€”â€Šcertainly not the goal we should be striving toward. The futures enabled by autonomous vehicles that prominent technologists have laid out are pure fantasy. If we buy into them, we may discover, in a decade or so, that instead of the emancipatory "individualized" transportation we were promised, we instead entrenched the worse aspects of automobility: longer commutes, more traffic jams, negative health outcomes from a lack of physical activity, and a further decline in the quality of mass transit. At a time when an increasing number of people accept that the suburban, auto-dependent lifestyle we were sold in the post-war period isn't as liberating as we were led to believe, doubling down on that very path of development would be foolish. We stand at a decisive point in determining the future of how we move in urban space. And honestly, not only can we do better, but we deserve better. Flourishing of new mobility options The enthusiasm of those who were once major backers of autonomous vehicles may have faded, but it hasn't disappeared; for some, it's been redirected to a suite of mobility services that are finding their way to streets and sidewalks the world over. But not without controversy. Docked bike-share services have been around for a while, with central stations where riders can rent or return a bike by interacting with a digital interface. In contrast, the new range of services that have gained attention in the past year scatter dockless bikes and scooters around the city which can then be activated through the respective company's app. However, it isn't uncommon for people to abandon their dockless bikes and scooters on the sidewalk, potentially blocking it for pedestrians and people in wheelchairs, and prompting a backlash from those groups. This is part of the problem with the rollout of new mobility services by private companies which don't first consult with the local government, and is precisely why many US cities quickly stepped up to regulate the new services. Putting aside some of the initial hiccups, there's a bigger question that must be asked: could these new services encourage more people to move away from cars and embrace more active forms of mobility? There's little data to form a conclusive answer yet, but there are some positive signs. A new study from Populus , a research group co-founded by leading shared-mobility analyst Regina Clewlow, suggests that electric scooters are seeing rapid adoption in the US cities where they're currently available. The residents of those cities tend to have a positive view of the services and the scooters seem to promote greater equity than docked bikes: women are more likely to use them and low-income groups are more supportive of them. Additional research showed that dockless bikes in Washington, DC were well-received and were more likely to be used in the city's black neighborhoods. However, the number of rides per dockless bike tend to be much lower than for docked systems, and it's still far from clear whether dockless services can actually be profitableâ€Šâ€”â€Ša necessity given they're operated by private companies. A recent piece in The Information suggested that may be difficult, as there's likely to be little brand loyalty for users of electric scooters. The reality is that many of the initial issues with these companies could be rather easily addressed with regulations on where the dockless scooters and bikes should be stored, the number that could be on the streets at a given time, and making the companies responsible when issues aren't addressed. When Lime rolled out in Paris, they first consulted with the local government, and as a result they hired a team to pick up and charge the scooters, and move them if they were in places they shouldn't beâ€Šâ€”â€Švery different from how they approached their entry into California's major cities. The issues with these new active transportation services do point to a larger issue present in many cities: there's a far greater percentage of street space allocated to vehicles than the percentage of people who use that mode of transportation. These services may have issues, but if they successfully entice more people to use them, they could help make the case for a more significant transformation of our streets. Reclaiming streets for people Think about the current layout of a street. Typically there's a wide paved space for carsâ€Šâ€”â€Šusually two to four lanes, depending on the area of the cityâ€Šâ€”â€Šthen a narrow elevated strip on either side for pedestrians. Some streets may have lines painted on the pavement near the sidewalks for bikes, while a much rarer layout will actually have a barrier to give bikes their own space protected from automobiles. However, as more people walk and switch to active mobility services, the pressure is growing for them to be allocated more of the limited street space, which is illustrated by some of the backlash to the proliferation of dockless bikes and scooters: pedestrians didn't like having their limited space further encroached upon. Out of nowhere, these new mobility options emerged, and it seems more people are at least giving them a try, placing more demand on the area that pedestrians, cyclists, and people using scooters are largely expected to share, while people sitting alone in massive SUVs get a ton of space to themselves, block buses from getting to their stops on time, and get angry if a bike goes anywhere near them. The status quo is not a sustainable street configuration, and these new services could help to change it. Tech startups are able to exert a disproportionate amount of pressure on local governmentsâ€Šâ€”â€Šjust look at how well Airbnb and Uber have avoid stricter regulations. Lyft and Bird have already proposed helping to fund protected bike lanes, and while having private companies pay for public infrastructure is not the path forward, their influence, combined with the voices of those already demanding such changes, could finally force local governments to take action and reinforce a positive cycle of growth in active transportation. People in urbanist circles are familiar with the concept of induced demand, which essentially states that when more of something becomes available, people are more likely to consume or use it. In the context of transportation, that means that if a government builds more roads, we're likely to get more driversâ€Šâ€”â€Šwhich is why so many projects to relieve congestion rarely work as more drivers fill the new roadsâ€Šâ€”â€Šbut if governments build wider sidewalks and bike lanes, we'll get more people walking and cycling. Beyond making transportation for more efficient, both environmentally and spatially, a greater share of active transportation would also have enormous health benefits and would save governments a ton of money . From that perspective, investing in bike lanes could have pretty significant returns. This isn't to say that there aren't real issues that will need to be addressed with the new dockless services and other forms of micro-mobility taking over our streets. It may be that these private services are not in the public interest, and some alternative run by the local transit agency will be a better option. Further, as bike and scooters are electrified, governments will need to determine the speeds and types of electrification that will be appropriate for their specific urban contexts. However, even with those considerations, the short-term ability of these services to introduce people to and encourage them to use bikes and scooters to navigate the urban environment are simply a preview of how mobility is changing and will force a renegotiation of street space to accommodate the growing number of people who are eschewing vehicles for other means of getting around the city. The future is coming, and it doesn't care whether technologists think they can profit off autonomous vehicles. People, carriages, and streetcars sharing the streets of Herald Square, NYC in 1884.
