Pentagon says China's armed forces are 'likely training for strikes' on US targets Reuters G Graham The United States continues to have the highest military expenditure in the world. In 2017 the USA spent more on its military than the next seven highest-spending countries combined. At $610 billion. Reply g gordon Every major military power conducts military training runs and reaction testing. Such as the regular Russian long distance bombers sent round to test British Lossiemouth reaction times off the Moray Firth. The US has clearly gone mad if they think this amounts to anything more Reply J Joe Public The American miltary/industrial complex is out of control. Per capita the US spends 10 times more than China... Reply 5 50 Cents America Has Been at War 93% of the Time â€“ 225 out of 242 Years â€“ Since 1776Since Space Force was announced, suddenly news on Russia's satellite's "very abnormal behavior"were reported, and now news on China's armed forces are 'likely training for strikes' on US targets. What's next??? Anyway, seems like a good strategy to request an increase of additional $1 trillion for defence budget. Reply K KarlMarx I only wish nations would spend more on their own countries and improve the quality of life for their own citizens before embarking upon space programmes. They should get their priorities right. Reply War what is it good for / Reply T TANDY China has to plan strategies that are realistic as you dont set your strategy against the Vatican military. I am sure the US sttategy is based on attacking China, so just accept this is all part of military readiness....end of discussion. Reply Fake News from the Pentagon! Reply c c Why shouldn't China or any other country improve their military etc? like many countries they probably feel threatened by America who for some reason thinks it own the world I think if America continues to threaten anyone who doesn't do as they are told by the US then they will get a shock and so they should. Why not try to live in peace instead of starting wars? China nor Russia has threatened America they have only proved they are not prepared to sit back and watch while America does what Hitler tried to do take over the world.We are in a very dangerous position now where pen pushers can start wars by advising their leaders that if we don't do so and so we will be bombed and so far everything that the US and UK has warned us about hasn't sodding happened just propaganda. It will be the innocent citizens who suffer if wars kick off while the rich leaders sit back and enjoy watching what they have created. I really hope that both China and Russia have enough technology to put the West in its place maybe then our leaders will stop trying to start wars with them and try and get along as neighbours. If they spent 1% of the military budget on the national health we would have zero waiting lists and much more healthy people it would help to find a cure for cancer instead of causing cancers by spreading toxins all over the planet.
