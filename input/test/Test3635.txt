Print This play video Some of the Katanga students protesting on the streets Alumni of the University Hall popularly referred to as Katanga at the Kwame Nkrumah University of Science and Technology (KNUST), say they will fight the University's decision to convert the hall into a mixed one with all arsenals at their disposal. The management of KNUST had earlier converted the two all-male halls of the school; University and Unity Halls to mixed halls, a move alumni fiercely resisted. But on Wednesday, August 15, 2018, management of the school announced that, with effect from the 2018/19 academic year, all six halls of residence of the University would be converted into mixed halls. The halls included the all-female one, Africa Hall. The management said the decision is "in line with the university's policy of periodic review of residential accommodation for students." It further noted that "the University's policy of expanding access to female students remain unchanged." But reacting to the decision, Nana Otu Turkson, a spokesperson of the Katanga Alumni, described the decision as myopic. "That decision doesn't make sense. It is not backed by any research. There is a plethora of academic work on the advantages of men and women getting educationâ€¦it just doesn't make sense." He said the association would ensure that management of the University rescinds its decision. "We are not in this for a short time. We are Katangees, we rest not [and] the allegiance will always be there. It doesn't matter how hard they fight â€¦we'll be fighting back we have secured an injunction to push it to the logical conclusion, not for ourselves. We are no longer on campus it doesn't benefit anybody, but for posterity and the future of Ghana." "We are not backing off; we will be on them until the right thing is done," he insisted. Meanwhile, some students have expressed dissatisfaction over the decision taken by the management of the University. We're not deterred by the lawsuit against hall conversion â€“ KNUST Management of the Kwame Nkrumah University of Science and Technology (KNUST) has said it is unperturbed by the lawsuit challenging its decision to convert the all-male Unity hall into a mixed one. George Tetteh Wayo, Public Relations Officer of KNUST, said the school would respond to the suit. "We are not deterred. They are right to do that, and we will respond appropriately," he mentioned.
