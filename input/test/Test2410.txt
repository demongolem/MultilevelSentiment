LUBBOCK, TX (KCBD) - This upcoming weekend will be a big one for the Texas Tech Soccer team. They will kick off the season on Friday against New Mexico, and then welcome in eighteenth-ranked Pepperdine on Sunday.
The Red Raiders and the Lobos have kicked off the season against each other for the past four years. Tech has beaten their regional rival each of those matches while outscoring the Lobos 6-1 in the process.
Despite Texas Tech's success against the Lobos, the team knows that they will be a tough test. New Mexico is coached by Heather Dyche, who has extensive experience with the U.S. Women's National Team and is a well-respected name in soccer.
"Well, UNM [New Mexico] is obviously a bit of a regional rival. Because we look at a lot of the same players in Texas, New Mexico, and Colorado. We have incredible respect for the New Mexico staff. I think she [Dyche] is one of the best coaches that we'll go against all year. There's a lot of familiarities there, head coach Tom Stone said. "We've beaten them in the spring and they've beaten us in the spring. It's a back-and-forth affair, so we just know that for opening night we've got our hands full."
"Friday night is just going to be so fun to finally get back on the field," junior midfielder Savannah Jones said. "New Mexico is always a good competition. We beat them last time, so I am sure they want revenge, but we aren't going to let that happen."
