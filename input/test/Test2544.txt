The Choctaw Nation in Oklahoma Is Using Drones to Trap Feral Pigs 0 Comments

Members of the Native American Choctaw Nation tribe in central Oklahoma are using drones to aerially refill feral pig traps, in order to somewhat curb the $2 billion in annual damages the animals cause, according to USA Today.
Coincidentally, this particular tribe hosted Intel's Open Drone ID demonstration alongside the FAA on Wednesday, and is implementing this aerial pig trap solution in Oklahoma as an official part of the aviation administration's UAS Integration Pilot Program. That initiative, of course, is comprised of select territories and corporate entities conducting semi-deregulated drone missions in order to eventually safely integrate UAV traffic into national airspace
