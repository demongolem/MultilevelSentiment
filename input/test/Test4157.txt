News Orange County News will stop using cameras next year to snag red-light runners.
To applause from red-light camera foes, City Council decided unanimously Wednesday it would use an escape clause in its contract with camera-vendor, American Traffic Solutions , and unplug the controversial intersection sentries effective Jan. 1.
"Come December, maybe we'll try to make a [marketing] deal out of it," first-year Mayor Bryan Nelson said. "Happy New Year! Come to Apopka, where we don't have any more red-light cameras!"
But Council's decision also cuts off a dependable flow of revenue from red-light tickets, which have raised millions for Orange County 's second-largest city over the last decade or so.
A violation based on video from red-light cameras costs $158.
The city's share of red-light ticket revenue in fiscal year 2017 was $1.33 million â€” before deducting camera rentals and other costs. The state's cut was $1.47 million, according to the Florida Department of Revenue.
"It should be about safety, not money," said Nelson, who pledged during his mayoral campaign to get rid of red-light cameras.
He said he wasn't convinced the devices made Apopka safer, citing a recently published, detailed analysis of Texas crash data that concluded red-light cameras don't reduce traffic accidents or injuries at intersections.
Nelson also said he hoped Apopka businesses would benefit financially from the decision to end the red-light camera program as some motorists who had avoided the city would return to shop, eat and rediscover the town.
The city has 20 cameras keeping watch over its busiest intersections, according to its website .
He recounted a story of a small-business owner who had ordered his employees to avoid Apopka if they were driving a company vehicle because of the city's bevy of red-light cameras.
"He told me, "I don't know which one of my guys was driving which truck on what day, but I know I'm the one who's eating the $158 ticket,' " Nelson said.
A red-light camera ticket is mailed to the licensed owner of the vehicle not the driver.
Council's decision followed appeals from camera foes, including David Leavitt, former Seminole County Libertarian Party chairman, and Glen Chancy, a 2014 mayoral candidate who also had campaigned on banning red-light cameras.

(Jacob Langston/Orlando Sentinel) Red light camera at the intersection of Main Street and Park Ave in Apopka on May 13, 20011. (Jacob Langston/Orlando Sentinel) (Jacob Langston / Orlando Sentinel) police Lt. Brad Dreasher, who ran that city's red-light safety program before retiring, now serves as a representative for American Traffic Solutions, also known as ATS. He compared red-light cameras to safety devices in motor vehicles.
"The safety program that has been endorsed by your police department professionals is used not only as a safety tool to catch red-light violators, who break the law and put your community at risk, but it is also used as a crime prevention and apprehension tool as numerous videos have been used to identify criminals, all at no cost to the city taxpayers as this is a violator-funded program," he told Council. "As you make your decision tonight, I hope you make safety your first priority. Seatbelts save lives. Airbags save lives. And red light cameras save lives." Our message is simple. Don't run a red light in the City of Apopka. It costs you hard earned money and most important it can save a life. â€” Apopka Police Department web page.
In 2007, Apopka became the first city in Central Florida to deploy them and, in fiscal years 2011-12 and 2012-13, Apopka collected more red-light ticket revenue than any Central Florida city, including Orlando, Daytona Beach and Kissimmee .
The city pays ATS $4,250 per month for each working camera.
An Orlando Sentinel tally of ticket data shows Apopka issued 194,545 red-light camera tickets between 2008 and 2017.
At a budget workshop in July, Apopka City Administrator Edward Bass estimated red-light tickets net the city about $800,000 after camera-rentals and other costs are figured in.
Of every $158 red-light-camera ticket, a local governments keeps $75, the other $83 goes to the state.
In Central Florida, red-light cameras are still in use in Daytona Beach, Edgewood, Groveland, Holly Hill, Maitland, Ocoee, Orange County, Orlando, Winter Park and Kissimmee. Red-light runners caught on film face $158 fines. Stephen M. Dowell / Orlando Sentinel Bryan Nelson celebrates his win in the Apopka Mayoral Race at his home in Apopka on March 13, 2018.
