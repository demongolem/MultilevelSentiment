Fusion Art is pleased to announce that Derwin Leiva has been awarded an Artist Spotlight Solo Art Exhibition on its website. The Artist Spotlight Solo Art Exhibition Series highlights individual artists of exceptional talent and skill who have an overall body of work to showcase.
Each month, Fusion Art selects one traditional, one digital & photography, and one 3-dimensional artist (if the gallery received 3-dimensional entries) for month-long online solo art exhibitions. The gallery created this solo art exhibition opportunity as a means for emerging, mid-level and, even, professional artists to gain more worldwide online exposure.
Derwin Leiva is the Traditional Artist Spotlight winning artist for the month of August 2018. As an emerging, Hawaii based, Cuban-American artist, Derwin's work represents various aspects of Cuba, including its political, social and cultural life. In his work he strives to depict a society that has experienced extreme oppression, but at the same time has a rich culture and is full of life.
Derwin's Solo Art Exhibition will be featured on the website for the month of August. The gallery will promote Derwin and his work on the Fusion Art website, in Fusion Art's Artsy.net Gallery, through individual online press releases to hundreds of outlets, email blasts, in online event calendars, art news websites and through the gallery's extensive social media outlets. The gallery's objective is to promote the Artist Spotlight winning artists, worldwide, to art professionals, gallerists, collectors and buyers.
In addition to the extensive online marketing and promotion, all Artist Spotlight winners receive an invitation to participate in Fusion Art's Annual Group Show that is held Palm Springs, California.
