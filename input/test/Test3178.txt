Mr. Ndu Ughamadu, said the contractor finance arrangement was still intact.
He said the Engineering Procurement Construction contractors and possible lenders were currently in Dubai to discuss the financing terms.
Commenting on the proceed of gas tariffs, Ughamadu said that the application of revenue generated from the tariff would be purely for loan repayment since the project financing was "Contractor finance".
''We wish to further clarify that part of the approvals obtained from the Federal Government is to fund the implementation of the project front-end activities tagged "Early Works" in order to continue to move the project forward pending the conclusion of the financing negotiations," he said.
