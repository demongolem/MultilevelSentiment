New Delhi, Aug 17 (IBNS): Former Indian cricket team captain Sourav Ganguly went down the memory lane to share a moment with former Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee, who passed away on Thursday.
Vajpayee, 93, passed away at the All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) at 5:05 pm.
Tweeting a picture which dates back to 2004, ahead of India's tour of Pakistan, Ganguly said: "Bharat loses its gleaming Ratna...An amazing soul .. may his soul rest in peace" Bharat loses its gleaming Ratna...An amazing soul .. may his soul rest in peace pic.twitter.com/Vxq4b2MW9O â€” Sourav Ganguly (@SGanguly99) August 16, 2018
India toured Pakistan to play five One Day International (ODI) matches and three Test matches after 17 years under Ganguly's leadership.
Vajpayee, the then Prime Minister, even gave a slogan "Jeet Lo Dil (Win the heart)" to the Indian team amid tension between the two nations.
Eventually, India had won both the ODI and Test competitions in Pakistan.
Vajpayee, a stalwart of Indian politics who represented the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), was a three-time Prime Minister of India.
A bachelor all his life, he was awarded the Bharat Ratna, India's highest civilian honour, in 2015.
Vajpayee was elected to the Lok Sabha (lower house) ten times and twice to the Rajya Sabha (upper house).
He represented the Lucknow parliamentary seat in Uttar Pradesh until 2009 when he retired from active politics. Sourav Ganguly goes down memory lane, shares image with late Vajpayee on Twitter India Blooms News Servic
