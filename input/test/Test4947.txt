Poor Infrastructure
A new study shows Rhode Island has nation's worse infrastructure which refers to roads, bridges and dams, according to a new study by 24/7 Wall Street
In RI, nearly a 1/4 of the roads are in poor shape,(24.6% the highest in nation), 23.3% of the RI bridges are deficient ( highest in nation) and 42.3% of the state's dams are at high hazard risk. The report calls this catastrophic conditions. The road conditions in Rhode Island are terrible as this comic jokes about.
The recent collapse of a motorway bridge in Genoa Italy is proof of just how hazardous it can be to drive over a deteriorating bridge. People were trapped and there were at least 40 deaths and many more injured. Others more have not been found.
Everyone knew of the conditions of these bridges, but no one did anything. This all brings us to the realization that we need to be careful when driving in Rhode Island over our bridges and roads. Let's not be fooled by it not being closed. If it looks in bad shape, it probably is. So don't use it!

Be warned! It won't be pretty! Stay Tuned Get ready, political football is about to begin!
