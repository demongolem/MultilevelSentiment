Orbis Research A Linear Voltage Regulators is a system used in order to maintain a steady voltage. Regulator resistance varies according to the load and results in a constant output voltage. This regulating device acts like a variable resistor and continuously adjusts the voltage divider network in order to maintain an output voltage which is constant. The Major regions to produce Linear Voltage Regulators are North America, Europe, China, which accounted for about 67 % of sales market share in total. China is the largest consumption region with a sales share of 31.83% in 2017. The leading players are TI, Infineon Technologies AG, NXP Semiconductors, STMicroelectronics, On Semiconductor, accounting for 49.03 percent revenue market share in 2017. Along with the development of Chinese domestic Industrial technology, Chinese Linear Voltage Regulators has been made a lot of progress, but it also has a long way to be advanced in the world, especially in healthy and environment products. Otherwise, most of Chinese companies are rather small, compared to other countries' companies. Over the next five years, LPI(LP Information) projects that Linear Voltage Regulators will register a 4.9% CAGR in terms of revenue, reach US$ 1370 million by 2023, from US$ 1020 million in 2017. This report presents a comprehensive overview, market shares, and growth opportunities of Linear Voltage Regulators market by product type, application, key manufacturers and key regions.
