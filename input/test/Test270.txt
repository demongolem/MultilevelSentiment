Allow women to rise to their full potential. Flickr-Jonny Yao By Homaira Kabir
No one story is complete, as Nigerian novelist Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie has said in talking about stereotypes. It cannot define the whole person, no more than it can define the whole of a gender, a class, a race. And yet, we humans build a single story about ourselves and others all the time.
As a mother of twins, I'm constantly asked "Which one of them â€¦" has some trait or feature that the otherâ€”by definitionâ€”cannot have. It's a shortcut that people use to expedite their understanding of the two, and yet it misses out on all the nuances, vagaries and wonderful paradoxes that allow them to be their best. Single stories may cut out the noise, but they also blind us to what is unique and brilliant in ourselves and others.
This applies to our beliefs about women today more than ever before. Women have had to abide by a single story of being nice, warm and nurturing for tens of thousands of years. It fit well with the societal role of caregiving that was the sole source of meaning in their lives. But times have changed and require an expanded understanding of the roles, responsibilities, competencies, and contributions of women in the workplace.
In their early years, women are taught to conform to societal expectations of how they should be. Modest, agreeable and likeable. Catering to other people's agenda. Surrendering to most demands. In doing so, they learn to reject parts of themselves others don't likeâ€”the beginnings of a long journey of becoming strangers to themselves. They then enter the competitive and performance oriented nature of most workplaces that expect them to be decisive, assertive and competent.
This story doesn't play out well either. If they comply, they are labelled as nasty, aggressive, "ice-queens", and a host of other uncomplimentary opinions expressed towards an assertive and successful woman. Women in the workplace are caught in the "double bind" of likeability and competence that has stalled the progress in women's advancement achieved over the past many decades.
The reality is that women are paradoxical by nature, and denying this paradox disconnects them from their authenticity and de-wings them from rising to their full potential. Organizations suffer as a result. Extant research indicates that companies with greater diversity at senior levels are more successful in many ways: higher returns on equity, lowered risk, enhanced problem-solving, greater innovation, lower gender pay disparities, better client relationships, and greater long-term focus. Besides, it's the right thing to do!
How do organizations manage these biases that are largely beyond conscious awareness so that women can voice their ideas and occupy their place alongside men all the way to the top? In my work coaching women to build their leadership presence, and in the years spent researching the swamp between competence and confidence where women have been stuck for far too long, I've found that the real shift happens when a woman's paradoxical nature is celebrated. This is where they are at their most authentic, and authenticity is the crucible for growth, productivity and fulfillment.
What Do You Reward? A 2014 study done for Fortune.com showed what most women have known all along. This "shaming" is especially detrimental for women who are relational by nature and who go the extra mile when they receive praise and approval. Recognizing and rewarding feminine qualities, times of collaboration and kindness, as well as times when women "pivoted" to show lesser seen sides of themselves, is critical to helping them be more authentic and successful.
What Goes Unnoticed?
Similarly, men and women can become more aware of subconscious biases by observing their views on career choice. A woman can take a closer look at whether her career path has been influenced by gendered work. She can also uncover her subconscious biases by reflecting on her views on other women. For example, how does she view women who are successful or in positions of power, and does she hold similar views of men? The famous Howard-Heidi case-study is an excellent example of such subconscious biases. Finally, she can reflect on her mindset around gender. Does she consider being a woman to be an asset or a liability at work? Because her decisions will reflect her gender beliefs.
What's on Your Walls?
Subtle changes to the environment can also have a big impact on women's attitudes and decisions. Numerous experiments have shown that having more images of women on the walls makes women more inspired to speak up and to feel more authentic in their career choices. This is even more important in male dominated workplaces and at senior levels, where women are typically confronted or ignored with an all men board room. To encourage not only diversity but also inclusiveness at the top, organizations would do well to put up pictures of powerful women.
In an increasingly complex and ever-changing world, a woman's inner paradox is an asset to be nurtured. Because the journey up to face our ambiguous world begins with the journey in that embraces it.
