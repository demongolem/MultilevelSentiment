Cloud Constellation has launched its space-based data security-as-a-service (DSaaS) global partner programme.
Dubbed the SpaceBelt Global Partner Programme, the plan will allow its partners to take advantage of its networked constellation of satellites to power customer DSaaS services.
The service providers, cryptocurrency exchange operators, teleport operators, managed service providers and satellite service providers access to the company's entire service portfolio, alongside marketing, technical collaboration and customer engagement support to help them sell the company's security solution alongside their other offerings.
Other benefits include the option of bundling together other equipment and products in their existing portfolio, including network and professional services to offer a fully-fledged security solution. Partners can also take advantage of SpaceBelt's other partners' expertise, adding on extra services to offer a better value proposition for customers.
Cloud Constellation chief commercial officer of Dennis Gatens said: "The immediate level of acceptance and interest in our global partner program validates the SpaceBelt DSaaS value proposition and the game-changing capabilities it brings to a service provider's portfolio."
He added: "An enterprise cybersecurity strategy is comprised of numerous technologies, applications and processes, but underpinning it with SpaceBelt DSaaS greatly enhances its effectiveness."
Cloud Constellation's SpaceBelt service uses a network of eight satellites in low earth orbit to store high-value and sensitive data from industries including the military, private enterprises and governmental organisations
