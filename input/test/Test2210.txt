Rules for e-cigarettes should be loosened to reduce smoking rates, say MPs.
According to a report by the Science and Technology Committee (STC), vaping is less harmful than normal smoking and the two should not be treated as the same.
The report says there needs to be an urgent review to make it easier for e-cigarettes to be made available on prescription, a 'wider debate' on vaping in public areas, and greater autonomy for the industry to advertise the devices as a 'less damaging option for smokers.'

However the recommendations have been blasted by some public health experts, with one saying the report relies completely on endorsements from 'e-cig champions'.

The University of Birmingham has done research which found the vapourised e-liquid fluid in e-cigarettes has a similar effect on the lungs and body that is seen in regular cigarette smokers and patients with chronic lung disease.
However chairman of the STC Norman Lamb said that current policy and regulations do not 'sufficiently reflect' the lesser harm posed by e-cigarettes than their traditional alternatives.
He said: 'Businesses, transport providers and public places should stop viewing conventional and e-cigarettes as one and the same.
'There is no public health rationale for doing so.
'Concerns that e-cigarettes could be a gateway to conventional smoking, including for young non-smokers, have not materialised.
'If used correctly, e-cigarettes could be a key weapon in the NHS stop-smoking arsenal.'
Public Health England (PHE) have estimated that e-cigarettes are up to 95% less damaging than regular smoking.
The committee of MPs said that while 'uncertainties' remain about the long-term health impact of the devices, they present 'an opportunity to significantly accelerate already declining smoking rates'. MPs want rules around e-cigarettes to be loosened to help smokers quit. (Picture: Bloomberg via Getty Images)
According to the report, around 2.9 million people in the UK are currently using e-cigarettes, with an estimated 470,000 using them as an aid to stop smoking.
Duncan Selbie, chief executive of PHE, said: 'E-cigarettes are not without harm but are way safer than the harms of tobacco.
'This is about comparing e-cigarettes to normal cigarettes, not fresh air. Advertisement Advertisement
'The UK leads the world in harm reduction from tobacco and there is no evidence that they are acting as a gateway into smoking for young people.'
The report comes days after a Professor David Thickett, of the University of Birmingham's Institute of Inflammation and Ageing, cautioned the public 'must be aware that these devices are not harmless'
