August 17 (Renewables Now) - The Vietnamese unit of Chinese photovoltaic (PV) products maker Trina Solar Ltd has signed a deal for a USD-30-million (EUR 26m) credit line with VietinBank Bac Giang Branch in the province of Bac Giang, Vietnam.

According to Trina Solar Treasury Director Tian Hong, the company will continue to raise its investment in Vietnam. At the same time, its new partnership with the bank will be extended to include investment in local downstream power plants and engineering, procurement and construction (EPC) services.
