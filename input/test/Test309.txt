Mr Sunkaraneni manages all ENT problems, including sinus, sleep apnoea, and hearing problems. Ear, nose and throat problems or disorders are one of the most common health complaints. The site explains that as the entrance to the body the ENT region is exposed more than other parts of the body to micro-organisms and pollutants. This makes it more susceptible to infection and inflammation. Lumps and bumps also arise in this region and can be symptoms of serious illnesses, such as cancer. GuilfordENT also treats patients who have concerns due to the shape and function of their nose, due to either functional or cosmetic issues. Functional problems, such as struggling to breathe due to a deviated septum, and cosmetic problems can arise from either the natural formation of the nose or due to injury or trauma to the area. These patients may be successful candidates for surgery such as rhinoplasty or septorhinoplasty.
