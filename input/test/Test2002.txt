Android Pie Won't Allow Third-Party Apps To Record Calls August 17, 2018
Majority of users use third-party applications to record calls on their Android device, and if you are a person who uses a third-party app for this purpose. Then we have a bad news for you, as the latest version of Android i.e. Android 9.0 Pie, will not allow the users to record calls.
Well, ahead of the official launching there was a report that the Android 9.0 will tighten the privacy of the user, and this may be the further steps of that efforts. As many developers reported that the Google has stepped the support of call recording functionality for the third-party applications on the latest version of Android. However, there is no word from the Google at this point of time.
Having said that, since the Android Marshmallow 6.0 the company stopped the call recording API. But a few developers find their way to keep the applications active on the Android devices, and now it seems that Google fixed all the loopholes completely and now the company doesn't want to give any chance to the developers of third-party applications for the purpose of call recording.
That said, the company only restricted the third-party applications to record the calls on the Android devices. But the smartphone brands which have their own application for this purpose can continue to record the calls.
Personally speaking, this is a really great move by the search engine giant Google. As in this way, we can stop many suspicious activities. And I do believe that Google will find a solution for the uses in prefer to record every call. Do let us know your thoughts in the comments section below
