Over a dozen leaders and industry insiders in cryptocurrency gathered in New York on Monday, March 26, 2018, for the Inaugural Crypto Business Forum New York. Roundtable discussions uncovered what lies ahead for the future of blockchain. The forum designed to collaborate and learn from visionaries and insiders, meet investors and to share best practices and governance. The rise of 'the ICO' in 2017 has been astonishing to watch. ICOs have followed the innovator's dilemma disruption path in much faster timeframes than technology has. The VC and Angel investor market, which maintains a chokehold on development projects, has now been uprooted by a decentralized, democratic model of global crowdfunding, that in some cases, is producing returns in the 1,000% range. With the diversity of each leader's background, including Key Sponsors Uulala , a blockchain company to empower the unbanked, and U.S. Olympic Medalist Apolo Ohno's organization HybridBlock , the group will collectively merge their knowledge. Industries in attendance include social impact, marketing and media, finance, data security, blockchain development, agriculture, cryptocurrency trading, personal development, fitness, cannabis, and sports financing. Each has navigated the ever-changing business landscape in the lightning speed crypto market and looks to further the impact blockchain technology can have on their respective industries. Ohno, a founder of the new cryptocurrency exchange HybridBlock, will take an active role in examining the ecosystem for global exchange. Another notable Key Sponsor Oscar Garcia of the financial technology company Uulala has a focused social impact outlook to share what it looks like to bring millions of unbanked users into the formal economy.
