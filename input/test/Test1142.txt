Provo â€¢ Getting around LaVell Edwards Stadium will be a bit easier in the future.
BYU announced Wednesday that it will be making several improvements to the stadium at the end of the 2018 season, but won't increase its capacity, which currently sits at 63,470.
Most notably, BYU will add structural sections at the four corners of the stadium to connect the stands at the mezzanine level. The sections, which will not include seating, will let fans walk between the stands without having to return to ground level.
An artistic rendering of the plan is not yet available but should be within the next few months, according to a school news release. The project is still in the design process and construction will begin at the latter end of the football season, but will not impact game-day access.
It is the first major renovation since 2012, when new LED video boards replaced the existing scoreboards in the north and south end zones and video ribbons were added that stretched along the top of the north and south stands.
Also, the elevator shafts were painted blue and topped with the oval Y logo.
In 2010, capacity was reduced to its current number when the stadium was altered to allow for more wheelchair accessibility.
The project to add walkways between the four separate stands will also increase the number of restrooms by adding women's, men's and family-friendly facilities on the north and south mezzanine levels. It is expected to be completed before the 2019 season begins.
At June's Football Media Day, athletic director Tom Holmoe announced a variety of upgrades to the fan experience that already are in place or will be in place before the home opener on Sept. 8 against California.
The upgrades include a state-of-the-art, large-venue WiFi system similar to many used in NFL stadiums. With that improved mobile connectivity in place, BYU has launched a new game-day mobile application built specifically for the stadium.
The app will provide real-time statistics, on-demand highlight videos, social media components and more.
BYU has also adopted the NFL's clear bag policy for all home games. Approved bags must be made of clear plastic, vinyl or PVC and should not exceed 12 x 6 x 12 inches. Season ticket holders have received a BYU-branded clear bag with their season tickets
