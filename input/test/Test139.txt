Helped by cooler temperatures and lower humidity, firefighters across California have gained the upper hand this week on the massive wildfires that have been burning hundreds of thousands of acres across the state this summer.
As of Thursday, the three largest fires â€” the Carr Fire near Redding, the Mendocino Complex Fire near Clear Lake and the Ferguson near Yosemite National Park â€” were all more than 70 percent contained.
"We are wrapping up a lot of these fires," said Scott McLean, deputy chief of Cal Fire, the state's primary firefighting agency.
"Weather was the predominant factor," he added. "The cooler weather has helped quite a bit. It's allowed us to get out ahead of the fires, and cut lines."
Two weeks ago, there were 14,000 firefighters in California battling 17 major wildfires. Thursday, that number had fallen to about 10,000 firefighters battling nine major wildfires, he said, several of which were burning in remote areas like Modoc County in California's far northeastern corner.

As of mid-day Thursday, the Carr Fire, which had burned 1,077 houses on the western edges of Redding, was 71 percent contained, at 214,527 acres, and was burning mostly in remote areas of Shasta National Forest, just west of Shasta Lake as fire crews continued to cut fire lines to slow its spread.
The Mendocino Complex Fire, the largest in state history, was still growing on its northern edges in Lake County and rural southern Mendocino County, at 366,037 acres. But it was 76 percent contained, up from 51 percent a week ago.
And the Ferguson Fire on Yosemite National Park's western edges was 87 percent contained, at 96,810 acres. All roads into the park were open, while 833 firefighters continued to firm up containment lines, cut down dead trees and begin mop up work â€” down from twice that number a week ago.
Yosemite Valley reopened to tourists Tuesday morning after being closed for nine days at the height of tourist season. But visitors already have come streaming back.
The Holy Fire, which had threatened thousands of houses in Orange County over the past week, was 78 percent contained on Thursday, at 22,986 acres.

Meanwhile, authorities provided accounts of how two firefighters died in the Carr fire.
A churning tornado filled with fire, the size of three football fields, quickly it took the life of Redding firefighter Jeremy Stoke, who was enveloped in seconds as he tried to evacuate residents on July 26.
The smoke-and-fire tornado was about 1,000 feet wide at its base and shot approximately 7.5 miles into the sky; it reached speeds of up to 165 mph with temperatures that likely exceeded 2,700 degrees Fahrenheit, said the report by the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection.
The 37-year-old fire inspector was driving his pickup truck down a Redding road, working on evacuating people from the larger blaze, when he radioed out a "mayday" call, according to the report.
Stoke said he "needed a water drop and was getting burned over," the report said.
Then Stoke's transmissions abruptly stopped.
Stoke's remains were not found until the next day, and it took more time to analyze the ferocity of the tornado that ripped roofs off houses and flung power line towers, cars and a shipping container into the air near the spot where Stoke was overtaken by the flames, according to the report.
"It was something out of this world, a perfect storm," Gary Parmely, who was Stoke's stepfather and raised him from the time he was a child, told the AP in a telephone interview Thursday. "It was incompatible with life, and he happened to drive into it."
Parmely said he has driven out several times to the site where Stoke died. American flags, flowers and a framed picture of Stoke have been left in memoriam. Cut off by fire
The report also detailed the death of private bulldozer operator Don Smith, 81, of Pollock Pines, who was killed when his bulldozer was caught in the flames while trying to improve a fire line, defending a home, during what the officials say were "extraordinary fire weather conditions."
Both deaths occurred within an hour and 50 minutes in one 3-mile stretch of the Carr Fire.
The Carr Fire jumped the fire line and a Cal Fire crew chief said he made several radio attempts to tell Smith to "get out of there." Two firefighters in the area also "recognized the urgency of the situation" and tried to reach Smith on foot, but had to turn back because of the encroaching flames.
Smith reported that he was cut off by the fire and was pushing on in his 2002 John Deere open cab bulldozer in an attempt to reach a safe area. He also requested water drops and four helicopters began dropping water through the smoke and flames around Smith's last known location.
Once the smoke cleared, a pilot saw that Smith's dozer had been engulfed in flames and there was no sign of the protective metallic tent that firefighters deploy as a desperate measure when they are about to be overrun by fire. After two attempts, a fire captain was able to reach the bulldozer two hours later and confirmed that Smith was dead
