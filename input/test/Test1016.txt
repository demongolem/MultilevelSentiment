Nigeria:Govt Tasks Herbal Medicine Practitioners on Cure for Cancer [Guardian] Abuja -Herbal and alternative medicine practitioners in the country have been encouraged to work towards finding a cure for cancer through medicinal plants. Category: African Health Source Type: news Related Links: A New Strategy to Uncover the Anticancer Mechanism of Chinese Compound Formula by Integrating Systems Pharmacology and Bioinformatics. In this study, we had integrated systems pharmacology and bioinformatics to explore the major active ingredients against cancer, targets for cancer treatment, and the related mechanisms of action. These targets were scrutinized using web-based Gene SeT Analysis Toolkit (WebGestalt), and 10 KEGG pathways were identified by enrichment analysis. Refined analysis of the KEGG pathways indicated that the anticancer effect of HJD showed a functional correlation with the p53 signaling pathway; moreover, HJD had potential therapeutic effect on prostate cancer (PCa) and small cell lung cancer (SCLC). Afterwards, genetic alterations ...

Authors: Rampogu S, Parameswaran S, Lemuel MR, Lee KW Abstract Fenugreek (Trigonella foenum-graecum) is used as a spice throughout the world. It is known for its medicinal properties such as antidiabetic, anticarcinogenic, and immunological activities. The present study shows the properties and the nutritional quality of fenugreek seed extract and focuses on screening of active compounds in drug designing for type 2 diabetes and breast cancer. Quantitative analysis was used to calculate the percentages of protein, carbohydrates moisture, fatty acid, galactomannan, oil, and amino acid. Phytochemical analysis reveale...

This study aims to elucidate the effects of ethanol extracts of LT (ELT) relative to the role of Runt-related transcription factor- (Runx-) 2 in the invasive and metastatic potentials of mouse colon cancer to determine the underlying mechanisms involved. ELT was evaluated for the antimetastasis activity using CT-26 colon cancer using wound healing, transwell matrigel, and western blot analysis. We used Runx-2-specific siRNA to further determine the relationship between Runx-2 and matrix metalloprotease- (MMP-) 9 in the migration and invasion of CT-26 cells. Runx-2 was first demonstrated to be a transcription factor that pl... A Comprehensive Review on Phytochemistry and Pharmacological Activities of Clinacanthus nutans (Burm.f.) Lindau. Authors: Khoo LW, Audrey Kow S, Lee MT, Tan CP, Shaari K, Tham CL, Abas F Abstract Clinacanthus nutans (Burm.f.) Lindau (Acanthaceae), commonly known as Sabah snake grass, is a vegetable and a well-known herb that is considered an alternative medicine for insect bites, skin rashes, herpes infection, inflammation, and cancer and for health benefits. Current review aims to provide a well-tabulated repository of the phytochemical screening, identification and quantification, and the pharmacological information of C. nutans according to the experimental design and the plant preparation methods which make it outstanding... Probabilistic Risk Assessment of Inorganic Arsenic via Consumption of Herbs Collected in Thailand. Authors: Monboonpitak N, Ruangwises S, Buranaphalin S, Ruangwises N Abstract Total and inorganic arsenic contents in ten commonly consumed Thai herbs, namely, bird's eye chili, cayenne pepper, celery, garlic, holy basil, kitchen mint, lemongrass, pepper, shallot, and sweet basil, were determined using atomic absorption spectrometry coupled with a hydride generation system (HG-AAS). Total arsenic contents in fresh herbs and lyophilized herbs ranged from 3.39 to 119 ng/g wet weight (wet wt) and from 41.0 to 156 ng/g dry weight (dry wt), respectively. Inorganic arsenic contents in fresh herbs and lyophilized herbs ran...

This study aimed to investigate the effects of crude graviola extract in vitro on breast cancer cells; in particular, we aimed to identify an agent against triple negative breast cancer (TNBC). We used the TNBC MDA-MB-231 cell line as the experimental model and the ER(+) non-TNBC MCF-7 breast cancer cell line as the control. We identified annonaceous acetogenins, including annonacin isomers, characteristic to this plant by using liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC/MS/MS). We observed a significant decrease in the cell viability in both cell lines within 48 h, whereas impaired cell motility and invasiveness w...

Authors: Tueche AB, Zingue S, Tchoupang EN, Gueyo TN, Gbaweng Yaya AJ, Njuh AN, Ntsa DM, Njamen D Abstract There is a long standing interest in the identification of medicinal plants and derived natural products for developing cancer therapeutics. The present study was designed to evaluate the in vitro and in vivo antiproliferative effects of Abyssinone V-4' methyl ether (AVME) on breast tissue of mice. The cytotoxicity of AVME was evaluated using MTT assay in four cancer cell lines (DU145, PC3, HepG2, and MCF-7). Further, a protective effect of AVME was evaluated on 7,12-dimethylbenz(a)anthracene- (DMBA-) induced ..
