his rehab from a strained left hamstring<br />, will not. That visual, and the daily reminders that Darnold is charging toward the starting job and Barkley has not touched the ball in a game since Aug. 9, is enough for some to already get antsy and give the Jets the inside lane en route to surging to the lead, as if this is actually a race.<br />To those who insist it takes three years to fully and accurately evaluate an NFL draft, we give you this: Can we know who came out on top of the Giants-Jets 2018 draft sweepstakes in barely more than three months?<br />Of course not.<br />Nothing counts, really, until Sept. 9, when the Giants face the Jaguars and then a day later, when the Jets play at Detroit. That is when the meter starts running on the careers of Barkley with the Giants and Darnold with the Jets. There are those who believe these players are inexorably linked, forever, because the Giants with the No. 2 pick could have had Darnold and passed, leaving him for the Jets at No. 3. It is not as simple as that.<br />see also<br />Sam Darnold&#039;s make-or-break game also Giants&#039; draft reminder<br />Four months ago, the Jets were focused on the Giants....<br />Players sharing a draft class are always compared with one another, most often when they share a position. This is not the case with Barkley and Darnold. And since when do the Giants hold themselves up to anything the Jets do? The Giants could not secure Barkley and simultaneously keep Darnold and the other highly rated quarterbacks away from any particular team. You pick one player and the others go elsewhere.<br />The last time they were on a field together was Jan. 2, 2017 in Pasadena, Calif., and it was a sight to behold. Barkley carried the ball 25 times for 194 yards and two touchdowns and caught it five times for 55 yards and another touchdown. Darnold led a furious fourth-quarter rally with 17 unanswered points in a breathless 52-49 USC victory over Penn State in the highest-scoring Rose Bowl ever, finishing with five touchdown passes and 453 passing yards. All anyone wanting to see greatness in either of these prospects had to do was open their eyes and take a look.<br />Perhaps Darnold excels against the Giants and nails down the starting job â€” if he hasnâ€™t already. The Giants have seen enough of Barkley this spring and summer to know they are going to make him the centerpiece of an offense that, yes indeed, has Odell Beckham Jr.<br />For now, the Giants are thrilled with the pick of Barkley. The Jets are thrilled with their selection of Darnold. Is there anything wrong with that?<br />Giants three to see<br />Showtime:<br />Remember the past few years when the coaching staff said not to worry after Eli Manning and the starting offense stumbled through the preseason and sluggish regular-season openers followed? Manning does not have to light things up in what figures to be his last action until the real thing, but a semblance of what his offense should look like would be comforting to fans anxious to again believe (or to continue believing) in the 37-year-old quarterback.<br />Fall in line:<br />Moving to a 3-4 defensive front means extra linebackers will stick around. How many? Eight? Nine? Ten? Big performances are needed here to sort through Romeo Okwara, Avery Moss, Ray-Ray Armstrong, Mark Herzlich and Calvin Munson (who is dealing with a concussion). Armstrong looks as if he has played his way onto the team. Connor Barwin appeared safe until he came away sore from the preseason opener. Which players will rise to the occasion?<br />Best foot forward:<br />Pat Shurmur asked Aldrick Rosas to deliver on a 55-yard field goal attempt last week in Detroit and the second-year kicker nailed it. There does not seem to be much margin for error here as Rosas tries to secure the job he held, shakily, as a rookie last year. Do not be surprised if Shurmur, even if the game situation dictates otherwise, at some point calls for a long field goal attempt just to test Rosas again.<br />Share this:<br /
