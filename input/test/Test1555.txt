Abstract:<br />(EN)<br />Method for cool drying gas, making use of a heat exchanger (2) whose primary section forms the evaporator (3) of a cooling circuit (4) with a compressor (6), an expansion valve (8) and a bypass pipe (16) across the compressor (6) with a hot gas bypass valve (18), whereby the method makes use of a formula that makes the link between the state of the expansion valve (8) and hot gas bypass valve (18), whereby on the basis of this formula: - either the state of the expansion valve (8) is adjusted as a function of the state of the hot gas bypass valve (18); or - adjusting the state of the hot gas bypass valve (18) as a function of the state of the expansion valve (8) or vice versa; or - the states of both valves (8, 18) are controlled with respect to one another.<br /></form><br /
