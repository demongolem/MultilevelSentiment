Reuters: IT as driving force behind Serbia's development 17/08/2018 Author Snezana Bjelotomic Reuters writes today about the accelerated development of the Serbian IT sector and its contribution to the growth of the country's gross domestic product, stating that Serbia, although a small IT player in the world, as well as in Western Europe, now generates 10 percent of its GDP from information technology. Serbia, a country that considers Nikola Tesla one of its famous sons, sees technology as a means of help to emerge from a decades-long economic stagnation in which Serbia fell into after the wars in the Balkans in the 1990s. Finance Minister Sinisa Mali says technology export has generated for the country one billion euro ($1.2 billion) in 2018 so far, compared to about 900 million euro in 2017, which puts IT among the top three export sectors, in addition to the automotive industry and agriculture, reads the Reuters article.

"Serbian companies are producing software for industries ranging from agriculture to medicine as well as Uber-type trucking and cloud applications, online games and testing. They are also running call centers and customer hot lines", Reuters goes on to say. Also, under the leadership of the Serbian Prime Minister, Ana Brnabic, Serbia is providing more support for the start-up scene and wooing international companies to set up operations in Serbia. "Information and high-end technologies and the digital agenda are the future of our economy," Serbian President Aleksandar Vucic told Reuters. "Serbia's IT sector is the product of our own intelligenceâ€¦we have to continue to train as many people as possible to work in this sector," he added. Reuters goes on to say that the leading global technology companies, including Microsoft, IBM and Intel have already established development centres in Serbia or have licensed outsourcing services to local firms, offering three times higher salaries than an average monthly salary of 420 euro, but these high salaries continue to be lower than those that would be paid out in the European Union countries for the same jobs. "Google is supporting Serbia's growing startup scene by teaming up its Google Developers Launchpad, designed to help developer communities and startups grow, with Belgrade-based tech community organization Startit. But, in an e-mailed note, PricewaterhouseCoopers warned the country must tackle the departure of its brightest young people, spur innovation and improve its regulatory framework, digital skills and outdated education system", Reuters reports. There were over 2,000 firms in Serbia's tech sector in 2017, according to an analysis published this year by the government's Commission for Protection of Competition, up from 700 in 2006, with revenues doubling to 1.5 billion euro. "Serbia's net export of all services to the EU has grown at an annual rate of 23.2 percent in the first half of 2018, driven by information and communication technologies and services sector," Reuters writes, remarking that according to the Central Bank's estimates, Serbia's economy will grow by four percent this year from last year's 2 percent.
