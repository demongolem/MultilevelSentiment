Fantasy football Gameweek 2 advice: three players to consider â€“ and those to avoid By @FantasyYIRMA . Aug 17 2018 7:03PM By @FantasyYIRMA . Aug 17 2018 7:03PM Hovering over that wildcard button already? Tut tut. Before you throw those toys out of the pram, heed the advice of our pals at @FantasyYIRMA We are part of The Trust Project What is it? Buy! Benjamin Mendy (Manchester City, DF, Â£6.1m) Selected by: 16.4% It turns out Manchester City's former pitchside 'Shark Team' social media consultant is also pretty good at football. Mendy racked up a huge 15-point score in Gameweek 1, banking two assists, a clean sheet and taking the three bonus points. The champions have a favourable run of fixtures, with Huddersfield (h), Wolves (a) and Newcastle (h) bringing them up to the first international break. With clean sheet potential in each, expect to see the Frenchman pushing forward at every opportunity. Bye-bye! Son Heung-min (Tottenham, MF, Â£8.4m) Selected by: 3.9% It's that age-old boy-meets-girl story. Son Heung-min joins Spurs. Son Heung-min is obliged to do National Service. Son Heung-min plays in U23 tournament for South Korea in the hope of winning said tournament to get excused from aforementioned National Service. Classic. You may think that this is a bit of a given, but let's look at the numbers. There are five million+ managers in the game. At the time of writing there are still 200,000 teams who own Son â€“ and that's after more than 175,000 managers have transferred him out after their mad moments of realisation. (Also, 1,690 managers have brought Son in this week ahead of Gameweek 2. There is no assistance on offer for these people.) Buy! Alexis Sanchez (Manchester United, MF, Â£10.5m) Selected by: 9.0% Sanchez has yet to demonstrate his terrifying ability with consistency at Old Trafford â€“ or much at all in fact. Having joined in January, it's past the point where he is bedding into a new squad or getting to know his new team-mates. Gameweek 1 was a mixed bag for the former Arsenal man. He did register a questionable assist but missed out on more points when a combination of Romelu Lukaku's finishing and Kasper Schmeichel's goalkeeping conspired against him. Next, United travel to Brighton, who looked vulnerable at Watford last week in conceding 19 shots. With less than 10% ownership, Sanchez could be a replacement option for a certain injured Belgian... Bye-bye! Kevin De Bruyne (Manchester City, MF, Â£10m) Selected by: 17% When reports came out earlier this week that De Bruyne had suffered a knee injury in training, there was a danger that the official Fantasy Premier League website would crash with managers logging on to drop the Belgian sharpish. The full extent of the injury is still unknown, but even with the best medical expertise we know it will be a number of gameweeks before he's back. More than 430,000 players have dropped him since the injury news broke. He's still owned by around 850,000 managers, but expect that number to plummet. Buy! Jamie Vardy (Leicester, FW, Â£9m) Selected by: 8.1% Gameweek 1 was certainly one for the defenders â€“ nine managed double figure point returns â€“ so it's only fair that this is shared out with the forwards now. Solid options this week include Sergio Aguero facing Huddersfield, Romelu Lukaku taking on Brighton and even Harry Kane against Fulham, who look good to let the England striker break his August goal drought. Premium forwards come with a premium price tag, however, so looking under the Â£10m mark to provide some value brings us to Leicester's Vardy (Â£9m). He looks a good option at home to Wolves this week, was sharp off the bench in GW1, and with the exception of Liverpool in GW4, Leicester have a solid run of fixtures through October. Bye-bye! Leroy SanÃ© (Manchester City, MF, Â£9.5m) Selected by: 12.2% It feels harsh to put SanÃ© in this listing, given how he was cruelly left out of Germany's squad for the World Cup and then only made the bench in Gameweek 1 for Manchester City. But Â£9.5m is a lot to have sitting on your fantasy bench. The real issue with City is their rotation and the sheer depth of talent that Pep Guardiola has at his disposal. Riyad Mahrez played well on his league debut, while both Raheem Sterling and Bernardo Silva scored and should retain their starting spots. SanÃ© has incredible ability and potential, but with question marks over game time he is an expensive luxury to own, prompting 80k+ managers to sell him this week already.
