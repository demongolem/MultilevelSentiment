Gringo 23 Views 0 Comments We're in an explosive era of growth. Thanks to the birth of the internet and our newfound global connectivity, generating a real income online, no matter where you live or what you do, has become a modern-day convenience. Gone are the doldrums of 9-to-5 employment and the necessity to head into a life-sucking corporate job. Today, the so-called "dream" revolves around the lifestyle entrepreneur, able to make money, travel the world and live life to the fullest from anywhere on the planet.
However, it isn't just about the digital nomad lifestyle that gets people so excited. More so than getting rich by any measure, the masses are merely attempting to wrap their minds around generating a respectable amount of cash, enough to satisfy their expenses and leave a little bit of disposable income at the end of the day. While many look to fulfill that desire, very few, in fact, are able to follow through.
While droves of individuals salivate over the ability to live, work and play anywhere in the world that they chose to, most are primarily fixated on the ability to just earn a bit of money online . One stream of revenue would likely make the world of difference to many folks. But doing that seems to be an ever-increasing technical challenge. So it isn't about getting rich for a large degree of people, but rather, finding a way to earn just a little bit more money without all the added time it might take.
As someone who's acutely interested in passive income and online marketing, I speak to a great deal of people who are successful, but rarely do I personally come across someone who's had such an immensely interesting journey that it screams attention. While success is certainly alluring, most people don't have the wherewithal to suffer through such life-altering and suffocating failures , and to not only reemerge on the shores of hope, but to create a life of sheer and utter abundance in the process.

Today, not only do we live in an exhilarating time filled with endless possibilities thanks to technology that we once considered to live in the realm of science fiction, but it's also a period that's deeply steeped in the expectancy of instant and real-time returns. The truth is that you can't get rich overnight. It takes hard work and effort. It takes persistence and massive amounts of action. It takes seeing things through and pushing past failure, even as much as you want to give up and throw in that proverbial towel.
For that reason, the story of an iconic online marketing legend and founder of, Real Estate World Wide (REWW), Kent Clothier , is one of the most inspirational modern-day fables about, not just attaining wealth at the highest levels, but also in reinvention, revitalization and the ability to produce multiple streams of revenue even when you're emotionally and spiritually bankrupt. This is an individual who played an integral role in building up a nearly $2-billion-dollar-per-year grocery-arbitrage business, but then walked away from it at 30-years old with no ownership retention.
With $2 million dollars still in the bank, he thought he was invincible. Fast forward 22 months later, and with just $4,000 left in his account, the walls were closing in on him. I'm all-to familiar with that feeling of despair and anxiety, of sheer and utter pain and panic, that it really hit home for me, as I know it does for others. The truth is that it's easy to make friends when you're riding high, but when you fall from grace and everyone around you disappears, you realize the importance of things like family and health over monetary achievements.
However, Clothier's tale is an epic one. He had succeeded almost his entire life, and from very early on. But when failure hit home and he was unable to recreate his arbitrage business on his own, the reality of the situation sunk in. With $4,000 left to his name, he happened upon an infomercial teaching real estate. It cost him $1,000 for that program, which was 25% of his net worth at the time. Petrified, he made the plunge.
Little did he know that it would be one of the best decisions that he had ever made in his life.
What Does It Take To Get Rich?
Before I dive further into Clothier's transformational story, I wanted to circle back to a very important concept that drives human behavior. Years ago, Sigmund Freud, the father of modern psychology, coined a concept called the psychic apparatus, the three-part behavioral mechanism that governs our minds.
The psychic apparatus has three main components: The Id â€” The id is the first part of the human mind that's formed. It's the basal and instinctive urges that drive us towards instant gratification, and it's hardwired into our genetic conditioning to eat, procreate and defecate, for example. The id creates the sudden urges of wanting what we want, and wanting it right now. Children are all born with the id until the other parts form, and if we were only left with the id, we would do, act, and say as we pleased all the time and anytime. The Superego â€” The superego is formed during the early parts of our lives and is created through parenting, community and societal beliefs and values. This is likened to the angel on the shoulder, so to speak, whereas the id is more like the devil. For each person, the superego has a different (big or small) role in their lives. The Ego â€” Consider the ego as the referee between both the id and the superego. The ego's job is to satisfy the id while also working within the confines of the superego. This isn't the ego in the traditional sense, but rather that component of the mind that acts as the primary driver of the psychic apparatus. Since every person is unique with unique experiences, the ego works differently in each of us.
Why is this so important to a discussion about getting rich? It's because, as human beings, although we understand the concept of not being able to get what we want when we want it, it's still such a deep and sudden urge that burns inside of us, that we have difficulty seeing the forest through the trees. The truth? We want what we want and we want it now. Even as adults. Why should we have to wait? That's the resounding line of thinking at least.
That might be why we have on-demand everything. We live in a society where fast food is prevalent and exists on nearly every corner or town across the United States and we're able to access all of the world's information in real time from anywhere we want from little pocket super computers. We can hail rides, find dates and do everything in a flash, instantaneously. Clearly, we want to lose weight and get right quickly and not have to wait, purely because our ids are so powerful.
However, this can be debilitating, to say the least. That's likely why we see so many get-rich-quick schemes and fad weight-loss diets. We want what we want and we want it now. But we can't expect that if we're serious about making a mark in business or society. Instead of instant gratification, in order to create sheer abundance, we have to do the most amount of work for the least initial return. We have to deliver massive amounts of value, and do so repeatedly. Plain and simple.
How To Arbitrage Your Way To Success
After an extremely intriguing conversation with Clothier, I began to better understand the concept of arbitrage and how anyone can use it to succeed in any industry. The difficulty here is first being able to identify opportunities for arbitrage, and later being able to fully leverage those on a larger scale. But once you find what works, expanding and scaling becomes almost instinctive and native rather than some grand hurdle.
If you're unfamiliar with the concept of arbitrage, here's how it works. Wikipedia describes an arbitrage as effectively, "the practice of taking advantage of a price difference between two or more markets: striking a combination of matching deals that capitalize upon the imbalance, the profit being the difference between the market prices ." Clothier was able to identify arbitrage opportunities in the grocery industry with precision. READ ALSO: Android users more likely to be unlucky in love, survey finds
However, what he didn't fully appreciate at the time was just how much others were helping in the process to push and enact those deals. When he walked away from a nearly $2-billion-in-sales company at the age of 30, he simply didn't realize that. In his own words, he was full of himself and entirely overconfident about what he could achieve on his own. His slow and steady decline in the 22 months that followed his departure from that business was one of the most brutal periods in his life, where he almost lost all hope .
One evening, late at night, during an infomercial, his prayers were answered. He discovered a system for wholesaling real estate and that's where he spent the $1,000 to grab it, at the time, being 25% of his net worth. However, within a matter of 21 days, he was able to use what he learned in that system to make $8,200. And although he had been making over a million dollars a year just several years before, that $8,200 meant the world to him.
It wasn't just the money, but more so, what that money symbolized. It was his ticket to something bigger and greater. He had discovered how to arbitrage in the real estate market by flipping contracts. Today, he's one of the world's most astute house flippers, but also a brilliant industry leader. He took what he learned by arbitraging in real estate , and created an entire real estate SaaS and training business, Real Estate Worldwide, around it, which currently has over 22,000 members.
Not only did he get richer than he could have imagined in his wildest dreams, but he also created sustainability. He was humbled by his past failures and he used that to grow, to identify opportunities and progress as a person. That isn't something simple to do. Many of our past beliefs and negative self-talk can easily limit us. But, when you're backed up against the wall, and your entire life is on the line, you'll often do what it takes to succeed.
Anthony Robbins often says that success is the product of one of two scenarios: inspiration or desperation. There's massive credence to that statement. Clothier was desperate. He had no choice. He wasn't willing to settle for a life of mediocrity, so he figured it out and marched forward, applying persistent action every single day, getting better and better.
In his first 18 months after that real estate infomercial and learning the arbitrage strategy, he did 91 wholesale deals and made a million dollars. He didn't need to use any of his cash to do it. He simply replicated the same technique he utilized in the grocery industry, but instead, did it for the real estate industry. And the results were unfathomable, allowing him to generate millions of dollars, almost on demand, while also becoming one of the leading internet marketers in the world, building up a massive list.
You see, Clothier didn't just apply what he knew to real estate, flipping contracts and houses for a significant profit, but he was also able to use his business and sales savvy to turn that information into a goldmine. He effectively created something out of nothing just by tapping into that hidden potential that's buried deep inside each of us.
Ways To Get Reach (Realistically)
The truth of the matter is that very few ever tap into their hidden potential inside. They relent to bad habits and the status quo, never really thinking that they can achieve their biggest goals in life. They give up and throw in the towel, calling it quits. But it's virtually impossible to get rich if you give up. Failure is just a stepping stone. It isn't the end of the road.
If you're serious about, not just making lots of money, but in creating significant wealth, here's a blueprint on how to do just that.
Step #1 â€” Add Massive Amounts Of Value
It sounds a bit like a cliche, doesn't it? Just add value, and everything will be better. But how many people do you really think go out there into the world with the desire to add massive amounts of value? Clearly, many people are out there to do the least amount of work for the greatest return. That mindset is born from the id. It's instinctive, and hidden within the far reaches of our subconscious mind. Overcoming that is a hurdle, but a very necessary one to make.
Step #2 â€” Be Grateful
It's really easy to look at certain strategies and techniques in business or in life that will help you make monumental leaps forward, financially speaking. But that doesn't take into account one of the most important ingredients for success. If you're serious about succeeding at the highest level, be grateful. Not tomorrow. Not in a few weeks when you get a raise. Right now. In this very moment. Why? Because it could all disappear in an instant. Appreciate what you have while striving for more.
Step #3 â€” Get Specific About Your Goals
Getting wealthy or attaining a certain level of income is just like achieving any other goal. To get there, you need to ensure that you set those goals the right way. Set SMART goals and be very specific about them. Don't set them arbitrarily in your mind. Write them down and come up with powerful reasons why you absolutely must achieve them. That's one of the biggest and most potent internal transformations that you could make in your mind.
Step #4 â€” Create And Follow A Plan
When an airplane leaves from one city to the next, it has a plan. Its plan is called a flight plan. It's a massive action plan that involves speed, altitude, direction of travel and many other facets. But what happens when there's turbulence or air-traffic congestion or it needs to change course for some other reason? The plane changes its plan. But it doesn't change its goal of where it's going. Create and follow a plan, and don't be afraid to change it if you see something isn't working.
Step #5 â€” Pay Yourself First
We've all heard the saying. Pay yourself first. But how many people follow it? The truth is that most of the world lives with a scarcity mentality. They go paycheck to paycheck, petrified of what might occur if they get sick or lose their job or something else traumatic happens. The truth is that if you don't pay yourself first, you'll never be able to get rich. It's part of having an abundant mindset and should be prioritized at all costs.
Step #6 â€” Mind Your Own Business
While it is possible to make a lot of money while working for someone else, the truth is that you should mind your own business. Start and grow your own business , no matter what it might be. Identify what you're really good at, and develop the skills into a business that you can expand over time. Don't look for instant payouts or overnight riches. The reality is that it's going to take time, so you might as well start now.
Step #7 â€” Contribute To Others
The last step resides in the concept of contribution. Even if you have no money, find a way to contribute to others. Look for opportunities where you can help those around you. Whether they're in need or not, this mindset will drive home the point that you have more than you need, even if you physically don't. Search for ways, every single day, where you can contribute either your time or your money to those who might be less fortunate, because that's the true essence of success in every form
