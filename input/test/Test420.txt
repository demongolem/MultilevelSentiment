Head coach Doc Rivers guided the Clippers to a 42-40 NBA record and a 10th place finish in the NBA Western Conference. Look for the Clippers to make some noise on the west coast in the 2018-19 NBA season! The Los Angeles Clippers share the spotlight with the Los Angeles Lakers at the Staples Center in Los Angeles. In 2011, the Clippers acquired Chris Paul and changed the team completely around. Along with Chris Paul the Clippers also have the high-flying Bake Griffin leading the team. "Lob City" has become the new nickname for the Los Angeles Clippers due to the outrageous dunks Griffin does on a nightly basis. The Clippers story began in Buffalo, NY. The Buffalo Braves joined the NBA, along with the Portland Trail Blazers and Cleveland Cavaliers, in the 1970 season. Following the 1978 season, the team relocated to San Diego, and soon after moved to Los Angeles six years later. The Clippers have been known as the worst franchise in all of sports history. They have failed to ever win a division title, or a NBA Championship. However, with the addition of Paul and Griffin the Clippers are looking to change that course.
