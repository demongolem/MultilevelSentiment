 COMMENT EMAIL MORE Citing health concerns and a 14-county state of emergency still in effect after flash flooding earlier in the week, the state Department of Health and Schuyler County canceled this weekend's Phish's Curveball festival at Watkins Glen.
"This week's severe storm created untenable conditions, including the inability to deliver clean drinking water to patrons and and vendors as confirmed by test results delivered today," the state announced in a release. "Working collaboratively with Watkins Glen International and Phish, the county and state explored all options to allow the event to continue as scheduled."
There is still a mandatory boil water order in Watkins Glen, Schuyler County. The legendary Vermont jam band noted its disappointment in a statement posted to its website .
"We are still in shock," the band wrote. "The entire site is already set up and ready to go after literally months of work by our beloved hardworking crew, many of whom have been here for weeks. Our families are here, our gear is set, our tents are up. We keep waiting for someone to come over and tell us that there is a solution, and that the festival can go on. Unfortunately, it is not possible."
