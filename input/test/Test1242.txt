He said a local district attorney had concluded years ago that the accusations had "no merit."<br />"I am confident these processes will, in the end, come to a similar conclusion," he said in July after Biegler announced the new police investigation.<br />But an outside investigator retained late last year concluded that the earlier district attorney's investigation was "flawed," Biegler said, and "substantial new evidence" suggested that Hart had sexually abused two boys in Wyoming.<br />PA grand jury report raises questions in other states<br />JUST WATCHED<br /
