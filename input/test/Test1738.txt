THURSDAY, Aug. 23, 2018 -- Some YouTube videos that provide information about facial plastic surgery procedures present biased information, and many do not include qualified medical professionals, according to a research letter published online Aug. 16 in<br />JAMA Dermatology<br />.<br />Brittany Ward, from Rutgers New Jersey Medical School in Newark, and colleagues searched for and evaluated the top 240 videos resulting from facial plastic surgery search terms. The videos were classified as being created by a health care professional, patient, or third party and were evaluated using the DISCERN criteria for assessing consumer health information for quality (1 indicates low overall video quality; 5 indicates high-quality source of information) and bias (scores ranging from 1 to 5; higher scores indicate less bias).<br />The researchers found that the most views were for the term "nose job," with 56,251,991 total views and a mean of 2,812,600 views per video. Overall, the mean DISCERN rating was 2.21; the highest mean rating was 2.75 for "blepharoplasty." The DISCERN bias rating was 2.78. A total of 94 videos did not include a medical professional; a U.S. board-certified physician was included in 72 videos, and they had a mean DISCERN score of 2.54. The difference between the mean DISCERN score of videos including a U.S. board-certified physician and those without a medical professional was 0.69.<br />"Further evaluation of the quality of plastic surgery YouTube videos is necessary to create criteria that would result in high-quality and highly viewed videos," the authors write.<br />&copy; 2018 HealthDay.
