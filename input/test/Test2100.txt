FOOTBALL: Banbury United looking to continue good start Mike Ford 0 comment BANBURY United boss Mike Ford is delighted at his side's good start to the season â€“ but is fully aware a real test awaits his side tomorrow.
The Puritans were frustrated when a goal seven minutes from time denied them all three Evo-Stik South League Premier Central Division points in a 1-1 draw at Rushall Athletic on the opening day.
But Banbury brushed off the disappointment to record a 2-1 home victory over Halesowen in midweek.
Ford's side host Leiston tomorrow, with their opponents boasting a 100 per cent record, having scored seven goals in two games.
And although delighted at an unbeaten start, Ford knows another tough game awaits.
"We maybe struggled at home a little bit last season, so to get a win on our opening home fixture was massive," said Banbury's boss.
"It is always important to get something from the opening day because that gives a new squad confidence.
"But to follow it up with a win on Tuesday was pleasing."
He added: "Leiston scored goals in midweek at Royston, who were decent last year, so it looks like they are strong."
TOMORROW'S SQUAD
Banbury Utd (v Leiston home): from Goff, Ngathe, Wise, Gabbidon, Hawtin, Self, Diggin, Shamsi, Henderson, Kazaboni, Finch, Johnson, Bell, Awadh, Whitehouse, Baker
