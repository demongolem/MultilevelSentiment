The South Australian Labor Party has conducted a detailed post-mortem of its 2018 election loss, admitting it was caught off-guard by the sudden collapse of Nick Xenophon's SA Best party.
The report also reveals Labor was campaigning to govern as a coalition with SA Best or a group of independents, rather than aiming for an outright win.
Labor has compiled what it describes as arguably "the most thorough review in the party's history" in the wake of losing government in March after 16 years in power, taking submissions from over 100 people involved in the campaign.
It described it as "one of the most unusual elections in living memory", with Nick Xenophon going from polling 32 per cent six months out, to not winning a seat in the Lower House on election night.
The report noted that while the Liberal Party rebuffed Nick Xenophon from day one, Labor "reacted rapidly and well" to the former senator's entry to the race in October, but didn't "adequately adjust our strategy and tactics" throughout the campaign.
It said some of its research showed the party "seemed to let the Liberals off too lightly as we were targeting SA Best".
The report was compiled by federal MP Nick Champion and former state MP Steph Key. 'It's time' factor just one of reasons for loss The election was predicted to produce a hung parliament, but in the end the Liberals claimed victory. Look back at how the night played out.
It outlined four reasons for Labor's loss: an "it's time" factor after 16 years of government, the redistribution of electoral boundaries, mistakes such as Oakden and Transforming Health , and "micro-level" mistakes in individual electorates.
Labor's two-party preferred vote has been declining since 2006, and the report outlined strategies to broaden its support base through both its policies and by pre-selecting candidates that appeal to a broader voter group.
It included a push to rebuild the base in regional South Australia, with the report admitting Labor's primary and two-party preferred vote in most of the state's regional areas was "perilously low".
There were seven recommendations for how Labor can position itself to win the 2022 election.
It noted a child born on the day Mike Rann was elected premier in 2002 would be celebrating his or her 20th birthday at the next election, and the party could not "assume that what served us well over 16 years of government will serve us well in the 2020s".

With the Liberals having access to the US developed i360 electoral data analysis system , Labor acknowledged is needed to improve its research and analytics capability.
It also said it needed to develop election strategies "years out, not months", a process that will also include early fundraising efforts "so that candidates and their team can devote the last 12 months to campaigning".
It said some candidates were holding fundraisers in the last two weeks of the campaign, taking them away "from spending time with prospective voters".
Labor's state secretary, Reggie Martin, has accepted all of the recommendations, saying that while meeting them would require significant work, if could be "the catalyst for electoral success"
