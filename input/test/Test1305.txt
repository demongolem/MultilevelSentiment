In 2016, these fans got a glimpse of a more personal side of the Justice when she published a book called "My Own Words," a compilation of a lifetime of Ginsburg's writings and speeches.<br />Here are 10 highlights that reveal the woman behind the bench:<br />A Nancy Drew-loving "twirler"<br />Read More<br />"Kiki" Bader grew up in a working-class neighborhood in New York where she learned the cello and was a "twirler," performing with her baton at football games and even in a Manhattan parade. She was heavily influenced by a mother who always wished she could have furthered her own education. Celia Bader's advice? "Be a lady" which meant, in part, that one wasn't to let emotions like anger or envy get in her way, and "be independent."<br />The young Ginsburg spent Friday afternoons at the library, housed between a Chinese restaurant and a beauty parlor, reading Nancy Drew. According to Ginsburg: "Nancy was a girl who did things. She was adventuresome, daring and her boyfriend was a much more passive type than she was."<br />An unlikely mentor<br />She credits her Cornell college professor, Vladimir Nabokov, the writer known for the novel "Lolita," with improving her writing skills. According to Ginsburg, she took Nabokov's advice to use words "to paint pictures."<br />In the book she tells her biographers, "I try to give people the picture in not too many words, and I strive to find the right words."<br />How Ruth Bader Ginsburg steered the court on Texas&#39; abortion law<br />Nabokov's advice was evident when Ginsburg joined an opinion of the court to strike down a Texas abortion law in 2016. In a brief two-page concurrence -- laced with a flourish of French -- Ginsburg got right to the point: "When a state severely limits access to safe and legal procedures, women in desperate circumstances may resort to unlicensed rogue practitioners,<br />, at great risk to their health and safety."<br />Partner in life<br />died in 2010<br />, was one of Washington's most legendary pairings.<br />Besides his legal expertise, he often told audiences that he took over the kitchen at the demand of their two children who recoiled at the idea of their mother's pot roast. The book includes a 2003 speech Marty gave summing up their marriage. The two were attending a play in New York just after the release of Bush v. Gore, the controversial opinion that cleared the way for George W. Bush's presidency.<br />As they walked down the aisle at intermission, the entire audience began to applaud and Ginsburg "beamed." Marty reveals that he leaned over and whispered to his wife, "I bet you didn't know there's a convention of tax lawyers in town," at which point he writes, "without changing her bright smile, Ruth smacked me right in the stomach, but not too hard."<br />Pathmaker: The Stephen Wiesenfeld case<br />As a young lawyer, she blazed trails to fight laws that discriminated on the basis of gender. Ginsburg, a keen tactician, knew that it would be particularly powerful if she could show that gender discrimination hurt men as well as women. As such, she represented Stephen Wiesenfeld, who fought a provision of the Social Security Act after his wife died in childbirth. As Ginsburg explained it in 2008: Wiesenfeld "sought to care for the baby personally, but was denied child-in-care Social Security benefits then available only to widowed mothers, not to widowed fathers. Stephen Wiesenfield won a unanimous judgment in the Supreme Court."<br />Supreme Court nomination<br />President Bill Clinton waited until after an NBA Finals basketball game to call Ginsburg to offer her the job on the high court in 1993. But the phone line, from the White House kitchen, went dead three times. Finally, Clinton got it right. "If I'm going to propose," he joked to Ginsburg, "we might as well have a good line."<br />One would think the first time that Justice Elena Kagan and Ginsburg shared a hearing room it would have been at the Supreme Court after Kagan was seated in 2010. Not so. Ginsburg reveals that during her confirmation hearing in 1993, she stared up at then-Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Joe Biden. Sitting behind him was Kagan, who was serving as special counsel to Biden during the hearings.<br />How Mitch McConnell won the SCOTUS fight (for now)<br />Sandra Day O'Connor<br />In a 2015 speech, Ginsburg praised Sandra Day O'Connor as a "true cowgirl, resourceful, resilient, equipped to cope with whatever fortune brings her way." She spoke of the time the "incomparable" O'Connor invited the Olympic women's basketball team to the Supreme Court's basketball court that is often referred to as the "highest court in the land."<br />One of the players passed O'Connor the ball, and she missed the first shot, "but the second went right through the hoop."<br />Early writings on faith<br />Listen to the podcast &#39;Beyond Notorious&#39;<br />Learn more about the life and times of Supreme Court Associate Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg through the eyes of the people who know her best.
