Do you want to help shape the future funding and governance of London's parks and green spaces?
The London Green Spaces Commission (LGSC) is a time-limited (initially 12 months) advisory body appointed by the Mayor of London and chaired by the Deputy Mayor for Environment and Energy. We are appointing up to eight Commissioners in addition to the Chair and the Vice-Chair. The Commission will include at least two representatives drawn from the London boroughs.
The aim of the LGSC is to support London boroughs to transform how they manage and fund their services, so that investment in parks and green spaces can be maintained and increased in the context of substantial and ongoing financial constraints. The Mayor wants London to be the world's first National Park City and for all Londoners to have locally accessible and high-quality parks and green spaces: the LGSC will help to achieve this aim.
The LGSC will have three primary objectives: To demonstrate the need for continued investment in London's public green spaces by boroughs and other key stakeholders, using our knowledge of their economic value To influence future investment decisions and leverage additional sources of funding and finance by building a broad partnership of key decision-makers To develop and test, in partnership with boroughs, sustainable business models for parks services in London The LGSC will collaborate with up to three boroughs on a whole service transformation, developing innovative approaches to funding and resourcing their parks services that go beyond traditional models, and develop a toolkit for wider use.
The role
Commissioners will play a vital role in securing and shaping the future of parks and green spaces in London. You will provide expert advice to shape the outputs of the LGSC, contribute to the work programme and promote its recommendations and findings. You will help to find innovative, sustainable solutions to the challenges facing the funding, governance and management of parks services.
We are looking for senior level experience and a proven track record in one or more fields relevant to the LGSC, including: public service transformation and innovation, public sector finance, social finance and investment, philanthropy, public health and wellbeing, land and property investment and management, urban design and innovation, community engagement and social benefit. Individual commissioners are not expected to have experience in all of these fields.
You will have an understanding of the challenges facing parks services in London. You will have strong leadership capability, as well as the ability to think strategically and creatively. Commissioners will be appointed for the 12-month initial term of the LGSC, with an anticipated time commitment of one day a month.
