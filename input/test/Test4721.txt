A popular Devon waterpark has hit out at a YouTuber who broke in and used the rides in the middle of the night, saying it 'could have ended in tragedy'.
YouTube sensation Ally Law and three of his friends apparently snuck into the Splashdown Quayquest Waterpark, Paignton last week and filmed themselves going on a number of the water slides in the early hours of the morning.
The video has already been viewed more than 659,000 times since it was uploaded on Tuesday.
But while it has gained laughs on social media Splashdown has hit back, saying that he could have suffered serious injuries as a result. Law and his friends broke into the venue at around 4am Read More Mystery surrounds Exeter's chicken nugget festival after cancellations around the country
Jackie Richmond, co-owner and group marketing director, said: "Following a break in overnight at Splashdown Quaywest we have conducted a review of security and check of all on-site facilities and contacted the Police, who had already been notified by a member of the public. The group simply jumped over the barriers to get in (Image: YouTube)
"Whilst the people who broke in and used the premises without permission, thought it would be a laugh they are very lucky to be in one piece.
"Water levels and pools can be drained overnight and this would not necessarily be evident. Dropping multiple feet into a concrete 'pool' or using a slide when dry, could have severe implications for the person falling, resulting in significant injury or worse.

"Sadly, they do not appear to understand that these places can be dangerous when closed."
Law told his YouTube followers he broke into the Splashdown, which is the UK's largest outdoor waterpark, with his friends just before 4am on Tuesday morning. They then stole a number of dinghies before jumping on to the rides (Image: YouTube)
"We're at this place, this mental place," he said. "This looks insane."
