Real Madrid are going to have to fork out â‚¬226M if they are be successful in bringing Spurs and England talisman Harry Kane to the Santiago Bernabeu this summer.
This is according to Don Balon , who note that the 25-year-old will be able to leave if an offer of â‚¬226M comes in for him, and that club president Florentino Perez is keen to bring him to the Spanish capital to bolster his side's attack this season.

Signing Kane would be a great move from Los Blancos, as it would see them get their hands on one of the best strikers in world football, as well as help their fans forget about Cristiano Ronaldo's departure this summer. Real are going to have to pay â‚¬226M if they want to be sure of getting Kane in this summer
The England international proved with the Three Lions at the World Cup in Russia this summer that he has what it takes to cut it on the biggest stage of them all.
The forward scored six goals in six appearances for Gareth Southgate's side, as he helped his nation secure a fourth-placed finish and the tournament's Golden Boot award.
If that wasn't enough, Kane's record with Spurs these past few years is one that definitely solidifies his status as one of the best in the world in his position.
Kane has scored 20+ goals in the last four Premier League seasons, something that has seen some claim he may very well be able to overtake Alan Shearer as the league's all-time highest goalscorer come the end of his career.
Real bringing in Kane this summer would be a huge boost for the club, as they'd see themselves getting one of the world's best players who will certainly contribute a huge amount of goals to their side in the years to come
