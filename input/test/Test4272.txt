GN Hearing has entered into a partnership with Google to enhance the experience of its user base. The partnership is all set to introduce direct streaming between Android devices and hearing aids, thus doing away with the necessity of an intermediary streaming device .
This not only enhances the experience of the hearing aid users by doing away with the hassle of having to use multiple devices for simple functions but also opens them up to a better use of a range of seamless android activities like allowing them to call friends; and enjoy music and brilliant sound experiences. This direct streaming is expected to be made available in recently launched hearing aids ReSound LiNX Quattroâ„¢ and Beltone Amazeâ„¢ in a future Android release.
According to the World Health Organization, around 466 million people worldwide have disabling hearing loss. This number is expected to increase to 900 million people by the year 2050. Google is working with GN Hearing to create a new open specification for hearing aid streaming support on future versions of Android devices. â€“ Seang Chau, Vice President of Engineering at Google
Anders Hedegaard, CEO, GN Hearing, for his part, has said, "We are honored to partner with Google for this important development, which will enable direct streaming for even more hearing aid users through their Android devices . This is another example of how GN Hearing relentlessly strives to drive innovation forward by developing new products and solutions with unique benefits for hearing aid users and audiologists around the world.
