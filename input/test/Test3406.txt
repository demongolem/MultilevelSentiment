Electric Heat Tracing Market 2018 | Product Differentiation and Innovation to Expertise New Growth Opportunities till 2023 QYReports - Friday, August 17, 2018. Submitted by QYReports . Electric Heat Tracing, is a system used to maintain or raise the temperature of pipes and vessels. Trace heating takes the form of an electrical heating element run in physical contact along the length of a pipe. The pipe is usually covered with thermal insulation to retain heat losses from the pipe. Heat generated by the element then maintains the temperature of the pipe. Trace heating may be used to protect pipes from freezing, to maintain a constant flow temperature in hot water systems, or to maintain process temperatures for piping that must transport substances that solidify at ambient temperatures.
