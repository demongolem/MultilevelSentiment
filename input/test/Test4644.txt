RIDGELAND, S.C. (AP) - A South Carolina woman has been arrested and charged with taking nearly $250,000 from Jasper County.
State Law Enforcement Division spokesman Thom Berry said in a news release that 56-year-old Denise Smith of Ridgeland worked in the Jasper County Finance Office.
She's accused of taking more than $247,000 between 2012 and 2017 and using the money for her personal benefit.
A warrant said Smith created invoices for a fake tree service which county officials paid. The warrant says Smith is seen withdrawing money from the non-existent company's bank account.
The sheriff's office asked SLED to investigate.
Smith is being held in the county jail. It was not known if she has an attorney.
