Earlier this week, after the hysteria-inducing 3-2 defeat at Brighton, the clubâ€™s share price went north of $24 for the first time on the New York Stock Exchange.<br />That means that those who bought shares when the Glazers put 10 per cent up for grabs in 2012 have seen them double, despite Unitedâ€™s on-field performance. Forget those lucky few.<br />The Glazers themselves put around Â£170m into a leveraged takeover back in 2005. Since then they have recouped that and then some. Their Â£170m is now effectively worth Â£3bn should they ever wish to sell the club â€“ and with the cash continuing to roll in, why would they?<br />Woodward is the Glazersâ€™ man and has been fundamental in managing their investment. The University of Bristol physics graduate who became an accountant for JP Morgan, worked on the takeover and has been influential in mining previously ignored territories since joining United in 2007.<br />On his lucrative watch, commercial partners have flooded in from all corners of the globe. World record kit and shirt sponsorship deals have followed. Others have frantically tried to play catch up.<br />Last year United recorded record revenues of Â£581.2m. Next month, Woodward will tell investors that they have matched that figure this time around.<br />Of course, all of the above plays into the hands of those who claim that Woodward is not a football man but some kind of city slicker who galavants around the world while Old Trafford is engulfed by angst.<br />That the dollar, rather than the derby, floats his boat. Those who know Woodward say it is these allegations that trouble him the most. He is a regular sight at Carrington, where he has an office. He moved his family, settled in London, to Cheshire. Those around the club at the time say he soaked up information from former chief executive David Gill before effectively replacing him.<br />Recently, Chivas whisky was announced as United's new spirits partner in a global partnership<br />United are now worth Â£3.1billion - the Glazers invested Â£170m of their money to buy the club<br />He shares Gillâ€™s desire to ensure United have a say in world football, taking a place on a number of committees including Uefaâ€™s Club Competitions SA, which advises the governing body on various affairs. His every working hour, they say, is devoted to making United successful on the field as well as off it, something which has been described as â€˜an obsessionâ€™.<br />There are other things away from finance, that fans will not see. Woodward is currently overseeing the biggest revamp of the academy since Sir Alex Ferguson arrived and was famously stunned to see City hoovering up Manchesterâ€™s best young talent.<br />At United they are already talking about a time in the foreseeable future when 50 per cent of the first team have come through the ranks at the club. While such talk is cheap until that happens, there can be no denying that there is a strong desire to go back to Unitedâ€™s traditions and club sources insist that Mourinho, never known as a developer of young talent, is on board with this.<br />Ultimately, United have no Premier League title since Sir Alex left, which is the currency that fans deal in. So is the criticism of Woodward, and the banner, justified?<br />David Moyes came with a recommendation from Ferguson. When that did not work, United went for what they thought was a personality big enough to restore them to the top. Louis van Gaal was heavily backed but again, failed to deliver. Then they turned to Mourinho who, most would agree, is as close to a safe bet as you can get.<br />United turned to Louis van Gaal after the David Moyes saga but the Dutchman struggled too<br />Most would agree that United turning to Mourinho is as close to a safe bet as you can get<br />Mourinho can complain about missing out on Toby Alderweireld and Harry Maguire but he cannot complain about not being backed. Over the two and a half years he has been at the helm Woodward has delivered 11 of the managerâ€™s targets, spending close to Â£400m in the process.<br />While there will be complaints about those United missed out on, that is not a bad strike rate. Just ask Mauricio Pochettino about that when he turns up with Spurs on Monday night.<br />Is it Woodwardâ€™s fault that two of Mourinhoâ€™s men, Eric Bailly and Victor Lindelof, lost the ability to defend against a Brighton side that, in all likelihood, will not trouble the top ten?<br />Is it Woodwardâ€™s fault that Romelu Lukaku and Paul Pogba (another two of Mourinhoâ€™s men) struggle to recreate their international form in a club shirt?<br />United's struggles on the pitch in the Premier League cannot be solely attributed to Woodward<br />Is it Woodwardâ€™s fault that stories about how unhappy certain players are continue to leak out of the dressing room?<br />Of course, you could say that all of the above goes back to him because he appoints the manager and on that front there is yet to be the type of success Unitedâ€™ supporters demand since Fergusonâ€™s departure.<br />But there is more chance of Woodward finally backing the right horse â€“ and Mourinho may well prove to be just that given we are only two games into the season â€“ than of those paying for that banner seeing a return on their investment.<br />UNITED'S COMMERCIAL PARTNERS<br />Chevrolet Principal
