British Columbians sweltering in this summer's heat are opening their wallets wider to try to keep cool, according to an online survey.
The results of a new poll by Research Co. released Thursday delves into what British Columbians were willing to shell out money on to beat the heat.
Frozen treats saw the biggest jump in popularity, with more than seven in 10 respondents reporting spending more on ice cream, popsicles and freezies this year compared to last year.
Millennials aged 18-34 screamed the most for ice cream, with 85 per cent saying they spent more on icy desserts this year.
Eating out, likely at places with air-conditioning, was another popular way to stay cool. Slightly more than 40 per cent of respondents reported dining out more, with people age 55 and older and Metro Vancouver residents leading the way at 45 per cent and 49 per cent respectively.
Cold drinks remain a go-to way to chill out in the summer months. The majority of respondents, at 45 per cent, said they bought the same amount of drinks like pop, beer and cider this year compared to last year. The exception was Vancouver Island, where more people, at 48 per cent, quenched their thirst with summer bevvies.

While British Columbians sought respite from high temperatures through food and drinks, appliances were left out in the cold: Only 15 per cent said they bought more fans and air-conditioners to cool down; about half said they purchased less.
The appliances were most popular in the Fraser Valley where 26 per cent of respondents said they bought more this year, compared to Metro Vancouver at 14 per cent and Vancouver Island at nine per cent.
The results are based on an online survey conducted Aug. 13 to 14 among 800 British Columbians. The data was statistically weighted according to the Canadian census. The margin of error is +/- 3.5 percentage points, 19 times out of 20.
