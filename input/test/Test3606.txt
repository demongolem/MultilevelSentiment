Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull has approved a radical redesign of his flagship energy policy to put a priority on price cuts rather than climate change targets in a bid to prevent a backbench revolt that could threaten his leadership.
The drastic changes will make consumer prices a key factor in deciding the scale of future cuts to greenhouse gas emissions, removing one of the biggest obstacles to a Coalition consensus on the National Energy Guarantee.
The controversial target at the heart of the policy, a 26 per cent cut to emissions by 2030, will be set by ministerial regulation rather than being cemented in legislation to avoid forcing Liberals and Nationals MPs to vote for a climate change target they cannot support.
The new approach also meets demands from Labor governments in Victoria and the ACT to allow the target to be changed by regulation, improving the odds of a deal with the states and territories to approve the NEG by October.
The revised approach will make affordability an essential consideration in any change to the target, with an expert panel or other measures being considered to put a check on a future government's ability to raise the target with the ministerial stroke of a pen.
Mr Turnbull will take the plan to federal cabinet on Monday night after finalising the details over the weekend. He spent most of Friday preparing the changes with Treasurer Scott Morrison and Energy Minister Josh Frydenberg.
Advertisement Mr Turnbull is under increasing pressure to rethink the energy policy amid growing talk of a threat to his leadership from Home Affairs Minister Peter Dutton, who is said to be considering his options depending on the mood of Liberal MPs once the energy plan is put into place.
The Prime Minister is inviting cabinet colleagues, including Mr Dutton, to dinner at The Lodge on Sunday night to prepare the ground for the energy debate and soothe any tensions over the government's direction and his leadership.
Dissent over the energy plan has fuelled another round of fervent leadership speculation, with former prime minister Tony Abbott and a handful of other MPs signalling they could cross the floor on the energy bill.
The overhaul of the NEG package is not expected to mollify Mr Abbott, with key ministers calculating he will cross the floor for personal reasons regardless of policy factors, but could satisfy other Liberals and Nationals who are hesitating on the question.
Radio host Ray Hadley told listeners on Friday that a leadership challenge was "happening for sure" in the next two weeks but some of the Liberals who have been calling for change on energy said the policy disagreements were not a leadership test.
"At the moment we're having a debate on policy and everybody should be focused on getting the policy as right as we can get it," said Liberal MP Craig Kelly.
"There is no doubt the base is very agitated but at the moment it seems very quiet apart from the media speculation."
Liberals told Fairfax Media they were getting messages from party members in the past week wanting the government to dump the NEG, dump the climate change targets and, in some cases, dump Mr Turnbull.
Another said a leadership test was possible if hard action was not taken on energy prices, but that this did not mean the party room had a "strong plan B" to justify replacing Mr Turnbull as leader.

"We are both very committed to the success of the Turnbull government, to winning the next election," said Senator Cormann, who is close to Mr Dutton.
Labor infrastructure spokesman Anthony Albanese said the speculation was another sign of the "chaos" within the Coalition.
"Dutton is just a glove puppet for Tony Abbott â€“ back there on the backbench causing all of this chaos," Mr Albanese said.
The Liberal and Nationals MPs in the lower house who appear willing to cross the floor include Mr Abbott, Kevin Andrews, George Christensen, Andrew Gee, Andrew Hastie, Barnaby Joyce, Craig Kelly and Keith Pitt.
The government only has 76 out of 150 seats in the lower house and cannot count on Labor support for its bill, leaving it exposed to defeat if several MPs join Mr Abbott in crossing the floor.
Cabinet ministers are hoping to secure support from two crossbenchers, Cathy McGowan and Rebekha Sharkie, to shore up the numbers.
The original government energy plan was to introduce a bill to Parliament in the week ahead to set a 26 per cent target to reduce emissions in the electricity sector by 2030 compared to 2005 levels.
As revealed by Fairfax Media on Thursday, the expanded bill will include tougher pricing measures to put pressure on retailers AGL, Energy Australia and Origin.
The measures will operate across wholesale and retail sectors and impose harsh penalties on the big companies that breach the rules
