HONG KONG (REUTERS) - A Chinese travel website backed by Singapore state investor Temasek Holdings hopes to raise up to US$300 million in a new funding round in which it hopes to value the firm at US$2 billion to US$2.5 billion, two people with knowledge of the matter said.
Mafengwo, or "wasps' nest" in Chinese, is an online community for Chinese tourists where they share travel tips and shop for bespoke travel products.
The company hopes to use the fresh funds to acquire better tourism resources and products and better monetise its current travel content, one of the sources, who could not be identified because the information is confidential, told Reuters on Friday.
The fundraising amount and the company's valuation could change depending on market appetite, according to the two sources. Mafengwo has been in talks with potential investors for at least a couple of months, they said.
Mafengwo did not respond immediately to a request for comment.
The company raised US$133 million in December in its series D fundraising round from new investors, including US private equity fund General Atlantic, travel sector investment firm Ocean Link, Temasek, Yuantai Investment and Hopu Investments, as well as existing investors - Capital Today, Qiming Venture and Hillhouse Capital Group.
Mafengwo and a number of customised travel services providers in China, such as Qyer, are gaining popularity as Chinese people are spending more on domestic and international travel.
