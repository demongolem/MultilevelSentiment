Through a multi-phase collaboration, WuXi will leverage and evaluate Cyclica's cloud-based proteome Ligand Express screening platform to investigate the off-target profiles of small molecules, apply Cyclica's novel and proprietary advanced AI technology to create state of the art predictive models for ADMET properties, and support the testing and optimization of Cyclica's next generation AI-based de novo drug design technology.
WuXi AppTec research services division vice president Dr Dave Madge said: "WuXi is on the cutting edge of integrating and leveraging innovative AI solutions in our capability platform, to streamline and create productivity in drug discovery.
"What makes Cyclica's value proposition unique is that they offer enabling solutions at various points across the value chain which we believe will help us take further steps in the right direction. We are excited to apply, evaluate, and support the growth of their technologies, and assess how they fit in our overall strategy to advance pre-clinical success."
Cyclica president and CEO Naheed Kurji said: "Over the past two years, we've built a strong relationship with the world-class team at WuXi, and we are thrilled to work closely and collaborate with them to advance our shared interests.
"For Cyclica, this represents an incredible opportunity to continue to drive our innovation plans, while gaining insights and validation from a market leader.
"This collaboration will enable Cyclica to advance our vision of enabling bench scientists with an intuitive and easy to use cloud-based platform that is built around an integrated network of technologies that support the design, screening, and stratification of better drugs."
Cyclica is a Toronto-based biotechnology company that is driving drug discovery by empowering scientists in pharma with an integrated cloud-based and AI-augmented platform that enhances how they design, screen and personalize medicines.
