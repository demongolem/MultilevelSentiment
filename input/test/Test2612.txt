0 The itel P32 was unveiled early of August, and is priced between UGX330,000 to UGX350,000 in the Ugandan market, available in all itel stores country wide, as well as authorized mobile phone dealers.
Unveiled early this month, we have our final review of the itel P32. I might say it's an entry-level smartphone that can have it's way to the top of entry level smartphones. With honorable mentions such a dual rear camera, a 4000mAh battery, Android Go Edition, and 18:9 aspect screen ratio, this a phone that can be highly recommend to first time smartphone users as well as average smartphone users.
Our full review after 2 weeks of usage.
Design and Display We received an ice blue unit of the itel P32 which is all plastic. Its screen is bright with a balanced contrast. itel added an aspect screen ratio of 18:9 aspect ratio pulling up and down the bezels. But seems the bezels are still kinda of big. The 5.5-inch IPS LCD capacitive touchscreen is still impressive for a budget smartphone couples a screen resolution of 720 x 1440 pixels with 282 pixels per inch density, this should bring out the details on the screen. itel P32 display.
Looking at its design and build, the power and volume buttons appear on the right. Unlike most smartphones that have a sim and microSD card tray at the sides, the itel P32's simcar and microSD card slots are placed behind, underneath the remove back plate. The fingerprint sensor is placed at the back, as well as the dual rear camera, and a single speaker that appears at the bottom left. At the front is the 5MP selfie camera which is companied by a single LED-flash and a phone speaker. At the top is the 3.5mm standard earphone port, while at the bottom is the USB port and a mouth piece.
The build of the phone is comfortable and can fit in ones grip. The flagship smartphone is all plastic. The itel P32 really looks good, and its one of those itel mobiles that is really presentable to someone. You might not know its an entry-level smartphone according to its build. Only its memory and storage, as well as the camera sensors do kill it, but the phone in general is still perfect and can be recommended to anyone.
The itel P32 comes with a pair of phone protector. That can keep the phone in good condition, most especially at the back. That covers everything expect the fingerprint sensor and the cameras. The front cover, covers mostly the sides of the phone. One can do without the other as we found out in our test, but it's best if you used both, gives a good touch and feel. itel P32 phone casing.
Performance, Storage, and Battery Life The performance of the phone is the biggest issue when it comes to a phone. Mostly everything, same case to laptops, tablet computers, PC computers, to mention a few. The best/better the performance, the better the decive. And this is why itel mobiles do fail a lot, but consider that they are entry-level smartphones it's fairly enough to the users â€“ who are not "maximum" phone users.
The itel P32 comes with 1GB of RAM and 8GB of internal storage â€“ which supports an expandable microSD card of up to 32GB. The Itel P32 is powered by an MT6580 Quad-core 1.3GHz processor. The interface ran smoothly, even with various transition animations.
While switching between apps, and browsing through heavy web pages, the performance was optimal. There were few lags when multiple apps were running in the background, while playing games. However, the overall performance is average for maximum phone users, and is best for average users. Playing extreme car drive on the itel P32.
Even though the game was skipping some frames, and automatically dropped graphical details it was much faster if no other app was running on the phone. The game was 58MBs and would play smoothly on a 1GB RAM with no apps running in the background.
The itel P32 is well backed on a 4,000mAh non-removable battery. During the unveiling, itel claimed the battery could last for 3 days on a single charge, and yes it does but only for minimal or average users. However, we did find out the battery gets stressed out for 3 day usage on a single charge which makes it weak. During other days, the battery only could last for a maximum of a day and a half on a single charge. We recommend you charge at least once a day. Having coupled on Android Go Edition, the phone's pre-installed Go apps facilitate a smooth and fast experience of the phone.
Software The itel P32 comes with Android 8.1 (Go Edition) mobile operating system. On the phones 1GB RAM it helps smoothen the phone's usage to give a fast experience to the user. Like we mentioned before in our quick review and unboxing, the GO Edition OS comes with pre-installed applications; Google Go, YouTube Go, Google Maps Go, Gmail Go which have smaller app size, consume less space, as well as consumer less data. The apps optimize the performance of the phone, it's only when a user starts uploading heavy applications on a 1GB RAM and 8GB ROM phone that the phone gets slower.
Cameras The cameras on the itel P32 are one of the selling points of the phone. Even though the cameras don't present very good photos, where some lose details, other appear blur, others over saturated, they cameras a fair enough. The itel comes with a 5MP sensor for the front facing camera and a single LED-flash. The camera did give some good photos that you could not expect from such an entry-level phone. As for the rear camera, the itel P32 is the first of its kind in the itel mobiles to come featured with dual cameras.
Each coming with a camera sensor of 5MP + 5MP with a supportive dual LED-flash. Both cameras (front and rear) from the output images, come with a resolution of 2560 x 1920 pixels for a 4:3 aspect ratio. However, you can still set to 18:9, and 16:9 for if you want.
What we liked Dual rear Camera. The red and black earphones that come with the phone give good sound compared to its phone speaker. 4000mAh non-removable battery that can last for at least 2-days and half.
What we didn't like Doesn't support 4G network connections. I think itel should see that at least its flagship smartphone do support the coverage considering the fact the newest flagships are in the pipeline for adopting 5G. We didn't like the funny emojis/icons that come with the camera as an addition feature to tweek your photos.
