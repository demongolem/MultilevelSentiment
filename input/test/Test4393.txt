This is the iPad app that I have developed. You can check it in your iPad. I need desktop web site version.
modern look & feel and responsive design. I need to pass test at first step.
So you can build first page and send me JPEG. If it's great, I will process continously.
Of course, I will pay you for first page. After payment is completed, please send me PSD or Sketch.
I need to complete this project shortly. Also I have donzen projects in future. So I am finding long term relationship designer.
Also I like Chinese designer (because of communication). But other location is fine..
Happy Bidding
