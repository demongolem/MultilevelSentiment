Cable Girls is a show about four women working in a phone company as operators. But this story is so much more than that. Set in 1920s Madrid, the show is a Spanish period drama which is airing on Netflix. The story starts with Alba or 'Lidia', as she is wrongly accused of murder and the only way she can save herself is by lifting something for the corrupt officer from the phone company. That is where she meets the other three women and their journey begins.
But this is not just any drama. The show is full of ambition, desire, jealousy, blackmail, love, secrets, lies and so much more. The story will teach you about discrimination in the workplace and women empowerment. These are enough qualities for anyone to keep watching the show and believe me once you start, you won't be able to stop. The only problem you will have with the show is that the seasons are made up of eight episodes only. So don't forget to add this Netflix original into your summer watch list.
