CoolSculpting targets and cools fat cells to temperatures that trigger fat cell death without affecting surrounding tissue. Mumbai: Allergan Healthcare India Pvt. Ltd, recently unveiled CoolSculpting, its latest technology in body contouring, in India.

The event was moderated by Monica Bahl â€“ Sr. Vice- President, VLCC on August 16 at Taj Lands End inMumbai.
Themed around "Fear No Mirror", the event iterated that it is possible for people to admire themselves in a mirror, rather than fearing those extra bulges. In a world where we aspire to be our best selves, our appearance plays an essential part in complementing our personality and talents. When it comes to aesthetics, research shows that we are more concerned about excess body fat than we are about the wrinkles on our forehead.
Speaking at the event, Sushmita Sen said, "I have always believed in leading a healthy and fit lifestyle as it is important not just to look good but to feel confident as well from within. As we age our bodies change too and it's amazing. Sometimes no matter how hard we try, how much you stick to a healthy lifestyle, some stubborn fat always remains. In such cases, there is CoolSculpting that may help people go that extra mile to look and feel more confident as it eliminates stubborn fat."
On the unveiling of CoolSculpting, Marc Princen, Executive Vice-President and President of Allergan International Business said, "As market leaders in medical aesthetics, we are very excited to unveil CoolSculpting in India."
He further added, "Globally, we are trend setters in non-invasive body contouring. Historically, body contouring treatments involved surgery e.g. liposuction. Today, non-surgical fat-reduction treatments are in the top 10 list of most popular nonsurgical procedures. We are confident that this FDA approved technology will revolutionise the body contouring segment in India."
CoolSculpting is a non-surgical, clinically proven treatment option that freezes away unwanted fat cells with minimal expected downtime. Using a cooling technology called Cryolipolysis, CoolSculpting targets and cools fat cells to temperatures that trigger fat cell death without affecting surrounding tissue. Once the cells die, they are then naturally removed by the body.
