Globally, oil prices fell on Friday, with US crude heading for a seventh weekly decline amid increasing concerns about slowing global economic growth that could hit demand for petroleum products, reported news agency Reuters. Brent crude oil futures were down 5 cents at $71.38 a barrel by 0050 GMT. US West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures dropped 4 cents to $65.42 a barrel.
