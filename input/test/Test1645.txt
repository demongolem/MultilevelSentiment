Authorities have not identified the owners of the mobile home vehicle, but that has not stopped the community affected by the Carr wildfire to send an outpouring of support in Facebook posts, letters, and cards. The trailer experienced a flat tyre on 23 July near Redding, California, and the steel rim of the wheel scraped against the asphalt, creating the spark which ignited dry brush near the side of the road. Redding resident Rachel Pilli read about how the fire started and posted on social media to see if anyone wanted to join her in telling the owners they were not to blame. "I was thinking if I could send a card, maybe my friends would also send a card" to show compassion towards the caravan owners, she told the local CNN affiliate. She said hundreds of letters poured in and are continuing to arrive. More than 450 people responded in a Facebook group called Carr Fire Stories, a community for those affected by the wildfire. The administrator posted this on 13 August in the group: " We personally know someone who's mom is a neighbor to the man who's trailer accident led to #CarrFire . Many have been thinking and praying for this man. We learned that his wife is blaming herself for the #CarrFire, because she asked him to take the trailer in the first place. She has been crying day and night on her couch". Pleading for only positive messages, the post said: "This may be one of our finest moments, Redding!" The fire has thus far destroyed 211,019 acres and was 65% contained as of mid-week, but that did not stop commenters from showing forgiveness towards the couple. Lesli Ritchie wrote: "accidents happen. There's no way you could have predicted this and beating yourself up doesn't do any good. I hope you can find peace in these messages and know that people do not blame you". " You cannot blame yourself for this! There was nothing you could have done differently and it is NOT your fault! Do not listen to those looking for someone to blame. Sometimes things happen and they are tragic, but the blame is not on you and never will be. Please feel all the love and support of this community," Elizabeth Rofkhar posted. Comments poured in from communities in Canada affected by wildfires and even as far away as western New York state
