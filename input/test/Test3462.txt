Head of Marketing Fertility @Clearblue @P&G JV @GlobalShapers Aug 13 How to use Artificial Intelligence to boost your image How many times have you looked at your profile picture in LinkedIn and asked yourself, "What does this picture communicate about me?" "Is this the best profile picture of me?", and again "What is my best profile picture for Facebook and for my next post on Instagram?" "What do people think about me?" Firstâ€Šâ€”â€Šrelax. You are not the only one asking yourself this kind of question. Social media and new technologies have transformed personal branding and made it part of our daily life. When Apple introduced the first front-facing camera in 2010 with the iPhone 4, nobody expected that the selfie trend would change our social life so much: a survey from Luster Premium White determined that young adults will take more than 25,000 pictures of themselves during their lifetimes. From such a huge quantity of pictures taken, how can you select the best picture to use on your social media? And what does it communicate? Secondâ€Šâ€”â€Šallow technology to help you. Artificial intelligence can reveal the secrets behind your pictureâ€Šâ€”â€Šand what people think about you. Cloud Vision API by Google Â© Giulia Zanzi, 2018 I can just see your grimace. Artificial intelligence might seem something very complex and far from our daily life. But it's not. So let's take a step back. What is artificial intelligence, often abbreviated to AI? Professor Malone , founding director of the MIT Center for Collective Intelligence , defines AI intuitively as "machines acting in ways that seem intelligent". We use artificial intelligence every day when searching for information on Google or checking our Facebook wallâ€Šâ€”â€Šmachines are working to deliver a better result, in line with our interests. So why shouldn't we actively leverage AI in our daily life? How can AI help us to select our best picture and to boost our personal branding? Three tips for using AI to boost your image: 1. Test. There are free computer vision APIs that you can use very easily. I would recommend trying Amazon Web Service Image Rekognition; AWS is always at the top of the cloud business (source: RightScale 2018 State of the cloud report ), so it's a good idea to start your learning journey with the market leader. You simply provide an image or video to the AWS Rekognition API, and the service can provide highly accurate facial analysis and facial recognition on images. You can detect, analyze, and compare faces for a wide variety of user verification, people-counting, and public safety uses. I find the age estimation especially amusing. While far from accurate (of course, I look much younger than that!), it still gives you a good sense of what AI will read into your image; keep in mind that APIs are improving day by day, so they will be very accurate soon. Anyway, aren't you interested to know the age estimate that the automated HR machine screening your CV for your dream job will assign you? 2. Focus. The rules of marketing don't change, but are just amplified by AI. Think about your audience. Think about the environment you are in. A picture with your trendy flipflops at the beach might not be the best profile picture for LinkedIn. What are the three top messages that you would like your LinkedIn picture to communicate? Google Cloud Vision API provides powerful image analytic capabilities as easy-to-use APIs, and it can detect and extract information about entities within an image across a broad range of categories. Google has a function called "Label Detection" that helps you to objectively understand what the main take-aways are from looking at your picture. 3. Be yourself. "There is only one you for all time. Fearlessly be yourself," as Anthony Rapp said. Be yourself, and be yourself consistently. If you think of yourself as a brand, it's crucial that people recognize a branded product easily. How quickly do you recognize the iconic Coca-Cola bottle shape? How quickly will a hurried Instagram user recognize your face while scanning his stories? You can use CompareFaces API from AWS, which compares the new image and the reference image, returning you a similarity score. These are just some first easy examples of what AI can do to help you select your best pictures for your social media, but that's just the beginning.
