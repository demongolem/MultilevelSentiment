Tweet Nitrogen pollution is a problem as big as climate change. Science might have a fix. Some think nitrogen pollution may be the greatest danger we face. The Stockholm Resilience Center, an organization that examines the largest threats to natural life-support systems, considers our overuse of nitrogen a more extreme risk to life on Earth than climate change. But a new paper, published in the journal Nature this week, uncovered a way that we could keep millions of tons of nitrogen fertilizer from evaporating into the atmosphere and running into the oceans. Nitrogen is a basic building block of our food, so farmers spread tons of the stuff â€” in the form of manure, compost, and synthetic fertilizer â€” on their fields. But only half of this nitrogen makes it into plants. The rest gets chewed up by hungry soil bacteria and turned into a greenhouse gas 300 times worse than carbon dioxide , or gets washed into waterways where it fuels an explosion of algae growth th... @greenminerals Â» 17 Aug '18, 6am Terrifying people this way is not gonna help to stop climate change!
