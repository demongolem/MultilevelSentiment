Angry Birds Maker Rovios Games Get Sales Boost Aug 17, 2018, 08:46 am 0 22 0
HELSINKI â€“ Rovio Entertainment (ROVIO.HE), the maker of the "Angry Birds" mobile game series and movie, on Friday reported an increase in second-quarter sales at its games business, providing a positive sign for investors after a profit warning in February.
The Finnish company, which listed on the stock market in Helsinki last September, reported lower second-quarter earnings due to declining revenue from its 2016 Hollywood movie, but the number of active players for its games rose more than analysts had expected.
Second-quarter adjusted operating profit fell to 6 million euros ($7 million), down from 16 million euros a year earlier and slightly above the average market forecast according to Thomson Reuters data. Relate
