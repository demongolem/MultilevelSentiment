Ei Publican Partnerships is celebrating a significant milestone for its managed tenancy model, Beacon, which now boasts more than 250 pubs across the UK.
The Black Horse, Monkseaton, helped Beacon reach the milestone when it converted to the model, which has been specifically designed to support tenants in delivering a great value based, predominantly wet-led offer to customers. The successful operating model provides support to publicans through a dedicated retail team focused on sales, marketing, customer service and cost control.
The Black Horse, which is run by Danny Cox and Phil Campo, has been trading extremely well since opening and even secured a nomination for the Ei Awards of Excellence, despite only being open for a short period of time.
Marcus Parton, Regional Manager, Ei Publican Partnerships said: 'While Danny and Phil are new to the industry, they make up for their lack of experience with bags of enthusiasm, drive and creativity, which has been the perfect recipe for success. It's truly satisfying to work closely with publicans and help them build a business.
'The Beacon model gives publicans the support needed to focus on creating community focused pubs that deliver exceptional experiences and memories to their customers. Danny and Phil have fast become excellent operators, going above and beyond by running events, engaging with regulars and keeping a keen attention to detail. I'm look forward to working with them and watching them thrive over the years to come.'
Under a Beacon Partnership Agreement, Ei Publican Partnerships works to create an enjoyable customer experience through delivering great retail standards and provides a range of business controls to help publicans ensure maximum profit potential, including a guaranteed gross profit margin.
Mark Brooke, Director, Beacon, said: 'We're delighted to have reached this milestone and will take momentum from this as we target further growth over the coming years. The Beacon model gives publicans regular contact, support and access to the decades of knowledge our business has amounted over the years. Combined with passion and enthusiasm, it's proved time and time again to be a recipe for success.'
Phil, publican at The Black Horse, said: 'Dan and I are local lads and business partners who organised sporting events around the UK, such as meet and greets with Anthony Joshua, Floyd Mayweather and Phil 'The Power' Taylor, at venues like the O2 Academy. When we organised events we only got the door takings and often discussed taking over our own bar or function space to host our own events. When we heard The Black Horse was available, we jumped at the opportunity - it is in an affluent area with the right target demographic and we knew we could make it a success.
'We worked closely with Ei Publican Partnerships to refit the pub, by introducing new lines and revamping the bar area. Analysing the local demographic and immediate competition, it was clear the area was crying out for a premium food offer, which we launched to great success. Having the freedom to do something a bit different, and by utilising our marketing skills, we have been able to draw crowds to several ticketed and non-ticketed events. The key is to always remain relevant and give people a new reason to return.
'The Beacon model has been pivotal in providing us with the support, knowledge and operational knowhow we need to drive the business forward. Trading is going extremely well and we are exploring opportunities to extend our lease at the site and renovate an upstairs function room; whilst also looking at taking on further sites under the model.'
