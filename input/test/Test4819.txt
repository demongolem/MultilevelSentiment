Banned Australian batsman Cameron Bancroft has joined English county side Durham as an overseas player for the 2019 season and will be available for club selection across all three formats.
Bancroft received a nine-month ban from Cricket Australia in March for his role in the ball-tampering scandal against South Africa while former Australia captain Steve Smith and test vice-captain David Warner were handed 12-month suspensions.
The 27-year-old has since played in the domestic Northern Territory Strike League and is also expected to play grade cricket for Western Australia club Willetton along with Big Bash League side Perth Scorchers.
"I am excited to join Durham for the 2019 county season. Having played at Emirates Riverside in 2017 I know what a great place it is to play cricket," Bancroft told Durham's website https://www.durhamccc.co.uk/news-and-media/bancroft-signs-for-2019 .
