NEW YORK , Aug. 16, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- The D. E. Shaw group, a global investment and technology development firm and a pioneer in quantitative approaches to trading and investment, today announced the formation of a new, independent machine learning research and development effort.
The new Machine Learning Research Group, which will operate in parallel to the firm's longstanding machine learning efforts, will be overseen by Dr. Pedro Domingos , who will join the firm as a Managing Director. Dr. Domingos will report to Cedomir Crnkovic , Managing Director, who joined the firm in 1997 and for much of his tenure ran the firm's futures and currencies systematic trading group.
"Over the past few decades we have developed and deployed increasingly sophisticated machine learning techniques," said Eric Wepsic , a D. E.

Pedro is widely recognized as a path-breaking expert on the research frontiers of machine learning, and we are delighted to have him onboard."
"Financial data sets are among the most challenging and fascinating ones for machine learning," said Dr. Domingos. "It's exciting to join the D. E. Shaw group, a pioneer of quantitative investing, to work on new avenues for attacking that hallenge."
Dr. Domingos is a leading authority on machine learning as well as an opinion leader on the issues surrounding it. He is a Professor of Computer Science and Engineering at the University of Washington , as well as the author of The Master Algorithm: How the Quest for the Ultimate Learning Machine Will Remake Our World , a best-selling book on machine learning.
