Many of them already call the Volunteer State home. CLOSE UTK freshmen do service projects on campus Michael Patrick/News Sentinel "We expect more students from right here in Tennessee in this class," said Fabrizio D'Aloisio, assistant vice provost for enrollment management and director of undergraduate admissions at UT Knoxville. He attributes the influx of in-state students to the university's amped-up communication efforts with more emails, more print materials and more travel to Tennessee high schools. Students were expected to start the great migration to campus on Saturday, Aug. 18, to settle in before starting classes Wednesday, Aug. 22. Buy Photo
Jerry McCrary and Ashton Patton are incoming freshman at at the University of Tennessee and are signed up for a 3-week Math Camp through the university. The two discuss their work during class on Thursday, August 9, 2018. (Photo: Saul Young/News Sentinel) Precise enrollment numbers are still changing, D'Aloisio said, as the university continues to receive applications and some students decide to pursue studies elsewhere. Total enrollment for the coming year will get an official count recorded on the 14th day into the semester. A ripple of leadership transitions The growth in first-year students comes at a time of major transition for UT Knoxville as interim Chancellor Wayne Davis guides the university through a period of uncertainty following the firing of former Chancellor Beverly Davenport in May . CLOSE A day after University of Tennessee President Joe DiPietro terminated University of Tennessee Chancellor Beverly Davenport, he announced that Wayne Davis will serve as interim chancellor. Angela M Gosnell, USA TODAY NETWORK - Tennessee A new board of trustees has also taken over leadership of the university system, with eight trustees committed to beginning a search for a more permanent chief. Further into the future, the board will also have to find a successor for UT System President Joe DiPietro, whose contract extends through June 2019, though he hasn't confirmed when exactly he plans to retire. Other leadership questions revolve around who will fill the role of vice chancellor for communications after Ryan Robinson left the post on the heels of Davenport's exit, as well as who will become UT's vice chancellor for research following the quick departure of Victor McCrary .

UTK students took part in team-building exercises such as painting flowerpots to be given to senior living residents and filling backpacks for students Tuesday, August 14, 2018. The team-building exercise was for the freshman class, which is slated to be the biggest in the university's history. (Photo: Michael Patrick/News Sentinel) One top leadership job already assumed by a permanent figure is provost, a role manned by David Manderscheid , who moved to the university this summer from Ohio State University, where he served as executive dean of the College of Arts and Sciences and vice provost for arts and sciences. Flat tuition, record donors UT Knoxville students returning from last year won't face a higher tab with their tuition as the UT System in June announced a plan to hold tuition flat at UT Knoxville and Chattanooga. UT Martin students will pay 3 percent more. In-state tuition and fees at UT Knoxville are hovering at $12,970, with out-of-state tuition and fees staying at $31,390. Buy Photo

(Photo: Michael Patrick/News Sentinel) Neither UT Knoxville nor Chattanooga has seen tuition remain level from year to year for the past 34 years. While pumping the brakes on tuition increases, UT Knoxville also hit a record fundraising total during the last school year, collecting more than $235 million and racking up more than 46,000 donors, according to a news release from the university. The school is nearing its $1.1 billion campaign goal with $1.025 billion already in its pocket, the release said. A head start Some members of this year's freshman class hit the college books early as 69 incoming students descended upon campus for three weeks to brush up on formulas and equations during Math Camp. The camp, stretching from July into August, targeted students whose ACT or SAT math score was below what they needed to earn enrollment into their required math course. It culminated in a placement exam that could reroute students into the necessary class if they succeeded with a high enough score. Buy Photo

Incoming University of Tennessee freshman, from left, Carlyleigh Travis, Jennifer Martinez, Savannah Allen, and Breanna Jones attend a UT Math Camp class at Ayres Hall on Thursday, August 9, 2018. (Photo: Saul Young/News Sentinel) "A lot of times math is what stops people," said Karen Pringle, a senior lecturer at UT Knoxville and a recitation leader for the camp, which works to help students break through the concepts they might not understand. Professors instructing the campers try to teach them different approaches to math concepts, "so they get maybe a broader perspective of what they're trying to learn," said Pringle, who's been involved with Math Camp all five years it has been in place. The professor devoted part of her last recitation with students to an interactive lesson through which they stood up and waved one hand through the air as she instructed them to make motions that corresponded with math functions. All together, the motions created a smiley face. "Math is fun," Pringle said as her students erupted in laughter and headed on their way for final preparations before their exam. Buy Photo
Zoe Edge attends Math Camp class at Ayres Hall on Thursday, August 9, 2018. Math Camp is an optional 3-week summer program designed for students needing to meet prerequisites for math-intensive majors. Completion of the camp also serves as a placement exam that can cover two semesters worth of math classes. (Photo: Saul Young/News Sentinel) But the learning experience adds up to much more for participants, who Pringle sees evolve over the few short weeks in which she crunches numbers with them. "They kind of come to us as high school students and they leave us as college students," she said. Eighteen-year-old Jerry McCrary, of Chattanooga, found value in the camp as it helped him get a sense of UT Knoxville's layout and where he'll take classes this fall. Camp counselors shepherded the incoming students around campus to help them run through their schedule and pinpoint where their classes are located, he said. Buy Photo

(Photo: Saul Young/News Sentinel) McCrary, a geology major, is most looking forward to "getting the college experience" and meeting new people as he becomes a resident of campus. But he's also feeling nervous in anticipation of more study time that may not jibe with his tendency to procrastinate. However, making his mother proud gives him plenty of motivation. "She's still working her fingers to the bone to make sure me and my brother get through college, and I'd hate for all that work to go out the window," Jerry said. Another nearly 500 freshmen, transfer students and veterans showed up to campus last week for the Ignite orientation program and devoted much of Tuesday to giving back through a community service project. While some painted flowerpots for the Sherrill Hills Retirement Resort and the Ronald McDonald House, others made dog toys for animals waiting to be adopted. Yet others prepared to-go bags for the homeless. The event teaches students what the university has to offer both on campus and off, said Madison Murphy, student director for the Center for Leadership and Service and a lead organizer of the day. "Our mascot is the Volunteer," Murphy said. "We should actually be out in the community and volunteering and doing service for organizations." Buy Photo
UTK freshman Chandler Nalls was one of 250 incoming freshmen and student leaders who painted flower pots for a senior citizen's home during a team-building exercise on Aug. 14. (Photo: Michael Patrick/News Sentinel) And for freshman like Gabbi Martin, a third-generation Volunteer from Morristown, the chance to arrive early on campus helped her get a good feel for her new home, even if it's not far from where she grew up. Getting to the university a little bit earlier, she said, "makes it seem like not such a big scary place and gives you some friends right off the bat."
