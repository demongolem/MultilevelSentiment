As a seasoned executive, I thought I understood the customer and their needs. After all, I discussed their strategy, established a trusted rapport and persuaded them to purchase our products and services. However, I never fully appreciated the trials and tribulations of our customers and, more specifically, information technology (IT) organizations, because I have never truly walked a mile in their shoes. That is, until I became a chief information officer (CIO). As CIO, every decision is a balancing act between running lean or investing in the future, embracing the latest technology or waiting until it is a bit more secure, and mending legacy applications or moving to an entirely new platform. The role encompasses all this and much more, all while staying hyper-focused on supercharging performance, stability and scalability. It's a predicament only CIOs can truly understand.
On paper, this made sense. However, the reality of the role didn't truly set in until I was CIO at a leading enterprise technology company where I was tasked with cutting costs, moving to the cloud, opening a state-of-the-art data center, enhancing our end-user experience and strengthening our security posture following a breach. Today, as a CEO, this unique vantage point provides me with the customer engagement insight and experience needed to confidently oversee a company's product strategy, marketing, sales and go-to-market activities. Here's how:
Look behind the curtain. While we may wish that implementing technologies at the enterprise level was as easy as it is at home, this could not be further from the truth. Before purchasing a product, IT professionals need to consider numerous implications and all possible outcomes. How will it interact with other applications? What security and business ramifications may arise? How much change or pain will it inflict on users? Will this work the way it should or become a point of failure? What skills do we need to successfully implement this technology? These insights are key when evaluating our product, service and support strategy at Puppet.
Be a customer of IT. In addition to my role as the CIO, I ran our centers of excellence and used the same tools we provided our employees. While some were innovative, others were less so. It's no surprise we were competing with shadow IT. This objective "customer" view enabled me to challenge the team to enhance our service delivery and user experience. As CEO, this means building better and more customer-centric products.
Empathize with your users. My employees may not have necessarily thought this was necessary, but I did. In one instance, I even remember employees complaining directly to me that an outage was impacting their ability to be productive at work and otherwise. As CIO, I grew a thicker skin, listened to constructive criticism and even learned to meditate. In fact, I still do yoga because patience is also invaluable as a CEO.
Listen to and learn from customers. As CIO, I created the company's "IT Proven" program to share our own unvarnished best practices and lessons learned with our customers. While it was therapeutic to commiserate with my peers, I learned that they were also grappling with IT challenges and I applied customer best practices within our own IT organization as a result. This proved that we still have a lot to learn from our customers.
Technology is important, but so is the partner ecosystem. I depended on business partners and vendors that understood our priorities and constraints and helped us build or buy the best solution to accomplish our objective. Today, I am leading a team that strives to do the same for our customers.
Without a doubt, there is no better way to get into the customer's head than walking a mile in their shoes. While becoming a CIO certainly isn't for everyone, the experience and customer engagement insight gained in IT is critical for all CEOs and leaders to understand and implement.
