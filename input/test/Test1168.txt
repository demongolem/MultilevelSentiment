BEIJING, Aug. 16 (Xinhua) -- More than 2.53 million malware cases were detected in China in 2017, up 23.4 percent, according to a cybersecurity report.
The report was released by the National Computer Network Emergency Response Technical Team Coordination Center (CNCERT) at its annual meeting, which was held from Tuesday to Thursday in Beijing.
"A large number of online malware has harmed personal information and property security," according to the report.
Illegal Internet service providers usually use malware to maliciously send information on fee deduction or consumption to mobile device users.
The number of Internet security loopholes saw a growth since 2013, increasing by 47 percent from 2016 to 15,955 in 2017, according to the report.
Effort should be made to protect various information and key infrastructure, CNCERT director Li Xiangning said, calling for increased research on new technologies.
CNCERT is a professional organization specializing in developing technical responses to cybersecurity threats. The CNCERT conference has been held annually since 2004. [ Editor: Zhang Zhou ] Share or comment on this article More From Guangming Onlin
