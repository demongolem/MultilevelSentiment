Save<br /></form><br />Jason Wilde breaks down the Green Bay Packers' preseason game against the Oakland Radiers on Friday night at the Oakland Coliseum.<br />1. NO REST FOR THE DEFENSE<br />It appears<br />Aaron Rodgers<br />and the Packers offensive starters will take the night off. The multi-use Oakland Coliseumâ€™s notoriously bad turf during baseball season might be one factor, but more likely, coach<br />Mike McCarthy<br />simply believes that that side of the ball has gotten sufficient in-practice work so the seven snaps the offense played together last week against Pittsburgh will suffice. Thatâ€™s not true of the defense, however, so new coordinator<br />Mike Pettine<br />will have most of his No. 1 unit out there against the Raidersâ€™ offensive starters for some â€” if not all<br />â€”<br />of the first half. Pettine will also experiment with combinations at several positions where the starters are not yet set.<br />â€œI like to mix and match and see who works well together and the chemistry with groupings and different safeties paired together or paired with different corners,â€� Pettine explained. â€œThe communication part is so important. Plus, we also have the added element of cross training. We had a lot of guys play their main position in the spring and early in camp. And now weâ€™re starting with guys that show that they can handle it, weâ€™ll start to train them (elsewhere). Because as you know on game day, we only have so many guys up. And if you have an issue at a certain position, as a coach you always want to be in a position to put your best 11 out there.â€�<br />JIM MATTHEWS, POST-CRESCENT VIA ASSOCIATED PRESS<br />2. TIGHT BATTLE AT TIGHT END<br />The addition of five-time Pro Bowl tight end<br />Jimmy Graham<br />was clearly the biggest offseason move the Packers made on offense<br />â€”<br />if you donâ€™t count parting ways with beloved wide receiver<br />Jordy Nelson<br />, whom theyâ€™ll see in his new Raiders No. 82 uniform<br />â€”<br />but Green Bayâ€™s renovated tight end group goes well beyond Graham.<br />Ex-Jacksonville Jaguar<br />has impressed<br />Aaron Rodgers<br />and his offensive mates with his understanding of the scheme and veteran leadership, and former University of Wisconsin standout<br />Lance Kendricks<br />has quietly had a strong camp, according to Rodgers. There may only be room for one youngster in that group, and while<br />Robert Tonyan<br />has flashed multiple times â€” including on a touchdown against Pittsburgh â€” he is still a work in progress. Itâ€™ll be interesting to see if this game delivers more insight at the position.<br />â€œThe depth that we have right now seems rare,â€� said offensive coordinator<br />Joe Philbin<br />, who spent part of his Packers coaching career as the teamâ€™s tight ends coach. â€œRobert seems to be a guy thatâ€™s getting better every day. Creates opportunities for himself. We noticed (that) the other day, even in the blocking. Itâ€™s a little bit easier to see him in the passing game because heâ€™s a big guy, he goes down the middle of the field, real nice catch in the end zone â€“ everybody can kind of see that. But heâ€™s done some good things at the line of scrimmage, even. â€¦ Itâ€™s a good group, itâ€™s a good room.â€�<br />STATE JOURNAL ARCHIVES<br /
