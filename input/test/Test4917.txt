What seems to be common sense isn't always so common. CEOs, executives, founders and entrepreneurs need to keep their focus on the future in order to expand their market share. However, being in the daily grind of a business can make it difficult to see the forest from the trees. Time and time again, brands and companies need to keep reinventing themselves, which means figuring out how to extend the life of a brand. Brand extensions are essential in every business, whether you are selling cars, creating new lines of business, consulting, upgrading restaurant menus or creating new attractions.
I got interested in writing about this topic after working with one of our clients, Tim Murphy, the CEO of a chain of family entertainment centers. I decided to further investigate the idea and have discovered three keys businesses can use to develop and execute brand extensions.
1. Take time to review and analyze the business.
Take time to review and analyze one's situation. New directions or industry changes can differentiate one's business from the competition. This process can keep one open to new opportunities that are unexplored or underutilized, and that can set one's company apart from the competition.
It starts with the person in charge, a notion my client learned. The CEO or, in some cases, the board of directors, should review a company's new opportunities on an ongoing basis since business is constantly changing. At a minimum, this should be done annually.
When Murphy became CEO of the company, it had been a trampoline park for 10 years, dating back to when the commercial trampoline industry was in its infancy. Today, there are hundreds of commercial trampoline parks worldwide and in the United States. Like many industries, there comes a point of saturation, and one needs to begin to differentiate one's business from the competition. The company realized this and added more attractions, which resulted in an increase in brand awareness, new sales, new opportunities and separation from the competition through the addition of new revenue streams.
The best way to compare competitors' products and product lines is to view them side by side. In the case of restaurants and retail products, I recommend buying the competitors' products and reviewing their details -- size, shape, color, customer-attraction factor, price, value to the customer, quality, quantity received for the price point. Try to figure out how your product and product line compare to the competition. Are you a low-cost leader? Does a competitor provide a better price point? Is your product of a higher quality? Or is it truly unique?
2. Specialize to open new and better opportunities.
Specializing can create new and better opportunities. Many CEOs get stuck on not wanting to lose business, so they try to do everything or latch onto every new idea. Don't waste time on so many opportunities, as one cannot be in all places simultaneously -- it can limit focus as new opportunities arise. Once a company identifies its focused strategic goals, eliminate everything else that really doesn't matter.
When a company specializes, marketing becomes stronger and easily recognizable to a product or product line. Think of McDonald's. I'm betting that you only go there for a specific product. The brand is more prominent in the eyes of the consumer, and in turn, a stronger loyalty is usually created in the consumer's mind to buy only the specialized product or product lines. Hence, with more repeat customers, there is more volume and a higher frequency at which the customer is buying the product.
I was once told about a company that produced premium gluten-free products, including pizzas, flatbreads, rolls, breadsticks, tortillas and other items. The owners' main concern was growing the frozen gluten-free product sales, and they would go anywhere to sell the products to restaurants. With no specific goals, however, they were wasting a lot of time chasing leads and retooling production lines for each order. Choosing to specialize in one product -- pizzas -- led to focusing on restaurants and high-end retail outlets, which resulted in doubling sales.
3. Follow your core fundamentals.
Follow your core fundamentals to open new and better opportunities.
Many founders create companies with few choices. That limits what it takes to be successful, and the source of many product extensions or new product creations. And too many companies try to reinvent themselves but forget what made the company special to begin with. Focus on your fundamentals to envision and create brand expansions.
The history of Apple and the company's innovation and ability to extend its brand is something to appreciate. Consider Apple's initial product, the Apple I computer. The technology and approach have had a lot to do with how the company has been able to extend the brand today. Then, the inventions of iPods, iTunes, iPhones, iPads and the Apple Watch came along, which are arguably smaller versions of what was originally created. Apple seems to make it look easy to extend its brand each time a new product is released, and the company uses its core fundamentals to spur new ideas and brand growth. Steve Jobs was masterful in spotting trends or creating new trends that would extend the brand for many years.
In summary, the extension of a brand can happen in many forms. It can take place through the review of one's business and by following industry trends to adapt to new products and opportunities. When not afraid to lose sales, specializing can reduce the noise around your business. Have confidence, and don't react to fears, but instead, focus on your specialty to grow. And capitalize on your core fundamentals, but make sure they tie to the core principles that your company was built upon. Follow these three keys, and unlock your firm's potential.
