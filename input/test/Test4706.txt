W elcome to a new feature for the 2018/19 Premier League season as we rank and rate the weekend's games according to interest and intrigue.
As the season progresses the significance of each game will become more important, but other factors such as styles, potential individual battles and entertainment value will be considered.
We shall endeavour to try and be as equitable and democratic as possible to ensure the Big Six do not win out every single week.
10th: Manchester City vs Huddersfield Huddersfield's point at the Etihad in May was a magnificent effort and spurred them onto securing their Premier League status at Chelsea, but City had already won the title. There is no such thing as a foregone conclusion in football, but this should be a stroll for City who start a run of six very friendly fixtures that offer the chance of seven wins from seven.
The one point of interest is how the champions cope with the loss of Kevin De Bruyne . The fact City failed to sign competition for 33-year-old Fernandinho does leave them in a slightly precarious position, but Pep Guardiola's system is so well choreographed that it can absorb the loss of an individual component. Even one of De Bruyne's class.

Should they squeeze past Olympiacos, then Burnley will qualify for the group stages and face six Thursday-Sunday turnarounds before Christmas. Sean Dyche's side were reliable at Turf Moor last season, but six of their home wins were by a one-goal margin so they need to stay on the right side of fine margins. Three clean sheets on the spin in all competitions show Burnley have lost none of their parsimony, and this is likely to be another low-scoring game.
8th: Everton vs Southampton (Saturday, 3pm) T he fundamental problem with this game is that there is not a decent striker in sight. Two teams who look short of firepower, although Everton have added quality on the flanks in Richarlison and Bernard. Southampton have not really backed Mark Hughes in the transfer market because...why would you back Mark Hughes in the transfer market? At his best, Hughes can get a team to function as the sum of its parts, but it's been a long time since his teams have amounted to more. His face doesn't quite fit at Southampton either.
10 Premier League players who could leave their club before August 31 7th: Cardiff vs Newcastle (Saturday, 12.30pm) F ew people west of the River Severn give Cardiff hope of avoiding relegation, but they need 10 or so wins from this type of fixture if they are to prove people wrong. Neil Warnock's team were a tad unfortunate not to convert from one of a few goalmouth scrambles from set-pieces at Bournemouth, but were predictably dominated in other facets of the game.
There is plenty of angst and consternation around Newcastle, but they too were creditable in defeat against Tottenham last week. On that showing, they will comfortably avoid relegation. New No.9 Salomon Rondon started on the bench on the opening weekend, but Newcastle fans will be keen to see him in action from the start.
6th: West Ham vs Bournemouth (Saturday, 3pm) A 4-0 defeat at Anfield is easy enough for West Ham to brush aside , especially with new coach Manuel Pellegrini trying to ingrain a more expansive style of play. There were worrying aspects in that performance however, that suggest all has not been fixed by a summer of spending. Central midfield lacks mobility and ball-winning capability - Jack Wilshere and Mark Noble were paired at Liverpool - and looks ill-suited to shield the defence. This is a particular problem for Pellegrini, who likes his defence to hold a high line and push up to the edge of their box when defending crosses. A high line without midfield players putting pressure on the ball can be suicidal.
Bournemouth at home is a less chastening test, and will give us a more accurate impression of where West Ham stand. Two Augusts ago, this was their first league game at the London Stadium. Two years on, are they any better off?
West Ham struggled to cope with Liverpool's tempo Credit: Reuters 5th: Brighton vs Manchester United (Sunday, 4pm) A lifeless performance at the Amex Stadium, albeit in a meaningless league game, was a low point in Manchester United's season last term. Jose Mourinho and United lifted the gloom slightly with a Friday night victory over Leicester, but the performance contained familiar problems. Last season, despite Mourinho's reputation for instilling defensive application, United were far too passive without possession and allowed opponents too many high quality shots and comfortable possession in their defensive third. David De Gea was the principal reason why they conceded only 28 league goals.
W ithout Nemanja Matic and Ander Herrera, Leicester found it alarmingly easy to play through United and find Damarai Gray and James Maddison between the lines. The absence of Matic and Herrera did quicken United's attacking transitions though, and they moved the ball from back to front well in patches.
Much was expected of Brighton who began with a disappointing defeat at Watford, but they are far stronger at home.
Why does Jose Mourinho sound so miserable at Manchester United? 4th: Leicester vs Wolves (Saturday, 3pm) T wo sides who will be encouraged by their opening day showings but have only one point between them to show for it. Leicester were excellent in response to Man Utd's early penalty, moving the ball with confidence and repeatedly getting into promising positions. Ben Chillwell, Maddison and Gray played with authority and verve, while the return of Jamie Vardy should provide greater cutting edge.
Wolves looked a little anxious at times against Everton and failed to take full advantage of Phil Jagielka's contentious red card. In hindsight, perhaps keeping three centre-backs on the pitch was a mistake with the extra man. Ruben Neves scored another goal from distance however, and Joao Moutinho will benefit from 90 minutes under his belt.
3rd: Tottenham Hotspur vs Fulham (Saturday, 3pm) Fulham have another London derby to contend with as Spurs return to Wembley, where they could remain for some time according to this week's news. Mauricio Pochettino's side adapted well to playing at the national stadium last season, enjoying red-letter days and nights there against Liverpool, Manchester United, Arsenal, Borussia Dortmund and Real Madrid.
Tottenham's new stadium in pictures T hey frittered away points against less glamorous opponents at Wembley however, when they struggled for creativity against obdurate rearguards and the atmosphere was eerily quiet. Draws against Burnley, Swansea, West Ham and West Brom were rueful, why they also scraped 1-0 wins against Crystal Palace and Newcastle.
T hat will give Fulham hope of getting a result, although they are likely to be more expansive with Slavisa Jokanovic steadfast in his refusal to park the bus. Should Eric Dier and Moussa Sissoko start in central midfield again for Spurs, then Fulham could justifiably claim to have better quality in this department in Tom Cairney and Jean Michael-Seri. If Fulham can avoid self-inflicted errors in possession, this could be closer than many think.
2nd: Chelsea vs Arsenal (Saturday, 5.30pm) Arsenal feature highly for a second successive week, as Unai Emery's fiendishly difficult start continues (things look more straightforward in the eight games that follow this one).
Chelsea beat one of the weakest teams in the division on the opening weekend as they saw off Huddersfield, while Arsenal lost at home to Manchester City. Neither result is particularly revealing, or relevant when considering how both Saturday's game might pan out with both teams adapting to new head coaches.
Games between these sides evoke memories of Didier Drogba terrorising Philippe Senderos and a physically imposing Chelsea grinding down Arsenal's ball-hungry artisans. That stereotype has been out of date for a few years now, and the teams are actually quite well-matched, sharing many of the same qualities and flaws.
Arsenal have a surprisingly good recent record Credit: Reuters A rsenal had a fine record against Antonio Conte's Chelsea, losing only one of eight meetings in all competitions including a comprehensive FA Cup final victory. They were the Big Six opponent Arsenal felt most comfortable and confident against by some distance. Last season, Arsenal emerged from Stamford Bridge with a pair 0-0 draws as two 3-4-3 systems cancelled each other out in both the league and the first leg of a Carabao Cup semi-final.
T his game should be more open, if only because both teams are prepared to take risks in their pressing and build-up play. Arsenal conceded space on the flanks against City, which could prove problematic against Maurizio Sarri who likes his wingers to hug the touchline. Emery's team could look stronger this week with Stephan Lichtsteiner, Lucas Torreira and Alexandre Lacazette in line to replace youngsters Ainsley-Maitland Niles and Matteo Guendouzi as well as the ephemeral Henrikh Mkhitaryan.
Chelsea will fancy their chances of exposing the lack of pace and agility in Arsenal's back four, while Emery's side will look to prey on David Luiz and Marcos Alonso on the left-side of Chelsea's back-line. Arsenal now mark man for man at corners rather than zonal - keep an eye on that against Sarri, who reportedly has more than 30 training-ground corner routines up his sleeve.
1st: Crystal Palace vs Liverpool (Monday, 8pm) Regardless of the result at Stamford Bridge, Chelsea and Arsenal will be in the hunt for Champions League qualification at the end of the season. This is precisely the type of fixture that will tell us whether Liverpool can push Man City all the way.
Styles make fights, and there will certainly be contrasting approaches on Monday night. A team happy to sit back and concede possession, with pace on the counter-attack and strength at set-pieces is precisely the type of opponent Jurgen Klopp's side have found troublesome.
L iverpool showed they are capable of toppling City in head-to-head meetings, their task is to avoid dropping points carelessly against the rest to ensure those game count. Selhurst Park was the scene of that infamous end-of-season capitulation under Brendan Rogers, but Liverpool have won there in each of the last two seasons to lay a few ghosts to rest. Virgil Van Dijk's presence ensures they are quipped to deal with high balls into the box, while Naby Keita showed against West Ham that his circulation of the ball can help Liverpool break down deep defences.
Crystal Palace's win at Fulham was no less impressive, and few teams are as comfortable playing without possession and waiting for their moment - usually through Wilfried Zaha.
