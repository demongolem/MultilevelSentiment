6. Nervous system diseases Diagnosis Of Gastroparesis
Your doctor will first review your medical history and the symptoms. Based on them, the doctor will perform a physical examination and take some blood tests.
Other tests used to diagnose this condition include: Barium X-ray - The patient will have to drink something called a barium liquid (barium powder mixed with water) which coats the lining of the oesophagus, stomach and small intestine. The X-ray shows the abdominal wall lining, size, shape, contour, and patency which help in accurate diagnosis of the condition. Gastric manometry - A thin tube is inserted through the mouth and into the stomach. This helps in measuring the stomach's electrical and muscular activities to determine the rate of digestion. Electrogastrography - This test measures the myoelectrical activity inside the stomach through electrodes placed on the abdominal skin. The recording obtained through this is called the electrogastrogram. Upper endoscopy - This is done by inserting a thin tube known as the endoscope down the oesophagus to examine the oesophagus, lining of the stomach and the upper part of the small intestine. Treatment Of Gastroparesis
Treatment can be done with the help of medications such as metoclopramide (to reduce nausea and vomiting), erythromycin, and other antiemetics. These are prescribed to gastroparesis patients to help the food pass to the small intestine and regulate the digestion.
Surgical treatment is done when people with gastroparesis are unable to tolerate any food or liquids. Doctors recommend a feeding tube to be placed in the small intestine. The feeding tube is usually temporary and is only used when the condition is severe or when blood sugar levels can't be controlled.
Researchers are continuing to come up with new medications to treat gastroparesis. Gastroparesis Diet: Foods To Eat And Avoid
