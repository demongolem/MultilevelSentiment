by Hadlee Simons 2 hours ago 30 A Google Pixel 3 XL has reportedly been spotted in Toronto, Canada. A photo of the phone seems to line up with previous leaks, including a prominent notch. Google is expected to unveil the phone on October 4, following the previous Pixel reveals.
We've seen loads of rumors surrounding the Google Pixel 3 series, but one of the more constant claims is that the Pixel 3 XL will have a massive notch. Now, a MobileSyrup reader has spotted what looks like the Pixel 3 XL in Toronto, Canada.
A photo of the phone was published on the outlet's Twitter account, and it certainly looks like the claimed Pixel 3 XL seen in recent shots . A @MobileSyrup reader spotted this possible Pixel 3 XL photo in the wild on the streetcar in Toronto, Ontario today. Our team thinks the photo is legitimate, especially given the big notch and substantial chin. Do you think this is a photo of the Pixel 3 XL? pic.twitter.com/nPTGHmIVUO

We can make out a large notch, housing the earpiece and what looks like two cameras (or perhaps a camera and unrelated sensor). We also see a prominent chin, which seems to line up with the latest leaks too.
There's nothing else to really glean from the photo, save for the fact that it seems to be running WhatsApp (big surprise). But this shot certainly seems to corroborate the previous Pixel 3 XL claims, so if you hate the look of the XL model, the smaller, supposedly notch-free Pixel 3 might be for you instead. Editor's Pick Android smartphones with the best battery life (July 2018) Some people might think that the most important feature in a smartphone is its display size. Others believe it comes down to a phone's processor performance, or the amount of RAM, or how much storage â€¦
In any event, we're expecting the Pixel 3 series to offer a Snapdragon 845 chipset, at least 4GB of RAM, and what seems to be a single-camera setup. Of course, the Pixel range also receives the latest Android updates, so Android Pie is all but guaranteed out of the box.
If Google's previous Pixels are anything to go by, we're looking at an October 4 reveal date. But will Google have any features left to share with over a month to go until the expected unveiling?
