Wallabies captain ready for injury return 1:14 pm
Wallabies captain Michael Hooper plans to "come out blazing" but concedes he may not last the full 80 minutes of Saturday night's Bledisloe Cup clash with the All Blacks in Sydney.
Hooper is returning from a hamstring injury suffered against Ireland eight weeks ago and says his meticulous rehabilitation program at both the NSW Waratahs and Wallabies had him ready to go.
"I've been lucky to have such a great team there to get me back into this game. I feel really ready and can't wait for tomorrow night," he said after Friday's captain's run at ANZ Stadium.
The ironman flanker has played virtually every minute of his 82 Tests for Australia but was coy when asked if he was 100 per cent confident in the hamstring.
"I'll tell you after the game tomorrow," the skipper said.
"It's one of those things; you tick all the boxes, you get to a point, I'm sitting here today feeling great about what I can do and I think I can make a difference in the game.
"I'm going to come out guns blazing."
The Wallabies are well covered for back-row replacements, with fellow specialist openside flanker David Pocock able to slot seamlessly into Hooper's void after starting at No.8 and 2018 Super Rugby champion Pete Samu at the ready on the bench.
"The best minutes to be on the field are at the back end of the game, so I'd love to be there," Hooper said when asked if he was likely to go the distance.
"However, it's what's best for the team and, if we can get a really good substitution there for myself or someone else, then that will be made."
Hooper said he, Pocock and blindside flanker Lukhan Tui were expecting another fierce battle at the breakdown with the All Blacks' loose forward trio of Sam Cane, Liam Squire and their own returning captain Kieran Read in his first Test back from spinal surgery.
"The speed of the ruck is so important at Test level,' he said.
"Yes, set piece has a part in handling momentum. But being able to maintain our ball and slow their ball is paramount.
"We know what they can do with ball in hand and we're fully capable of scoring points (with possession).
"So getting that area sorted is paramount, but the Kiwi players are very good there as well.
