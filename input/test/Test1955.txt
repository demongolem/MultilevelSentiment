Babies Born Dependent On Opioids Need Touch, Not Tech By Alex Smith â€¢ 11 hours ago Victoria gave birth to her daughter Lili while in treatment for opioid dependency. Alex Smith / KCUR / Originally published on August 16, 2018 6:54 pm
Dr. Jodi Jackson has worked for years to address infant mortality in Kansas. Often, that means she is treating newborns in a high-tech neonatal intensive care unit with sophisticated equipment whirring and beeping. That is exactly the wrong place for an infant like Lili.
Lili's mother, Victoria, used heroin for the first two-thirds of her pregnancy and hated herself for it. (NPR is using her first name only, because she has used illegal drugs.)
"When you are in withdrawal, you feel your baby that's in withdrawal too," says Victoria, recalling the sensations she remembers from her pregnancy. "You feel your baby uncomfortable inside of you, and you know that. And then you use and then the baby's not [uncomfortable], and that's a really awful, vulgar thought, but it's true. That's how it is. It's terrible."
Though Victoria went into recovery before giving birth, Lili was born dependent on the methadone Victoria took to treat her opioid addiction. Treatment for infants like Lili has evolved, Jackson says.
"What happened 10, 15 years ago, is [drug dependent] babies were immediately removed from the mom, and they were put in an ICU warmer with bright lights with nobody holding them," says Jackson, who is a neonatologist at Children's Mercy Hospital in Kansas City, Missouri. "Of course, they are going to be upset about that! And so the risk of withdrawal is much higher."
Jackson is now heading a statewide effort to get hospitals in Kansas to change their approach to treating neonatal abstinence syndrome, as the condition is formally known. Babies with this condition will scream inconsolably, clench their muscles and often have trouble sleeping.
The treatment Jackson recommends is to keep mothers and their infants together in the hospital, making sure babies are held and comforted--and to provide opioids (in gradually decreasing quantities) to ease withdrawal symptoms until the baby can be weaned off of them. Research shows that this approach is more effective than keeping the baby in the NICU, which is a common practice.
It's estimated that around 2 percent of infants are now born drug dependent, and in areas gripped by the opioid crisis, those numbers are even higher.
The low-tech, high-touch treatment approach that Lili received in the first weeks of her life is one that health experts are encouraging hospitals everywhere to adopt as they grapple with the increasing numbers of infants born with drug dependencies.
Jackson says that, in parts of Kansas, she's starting from scratch.
"Many hospitals have no standard of practice. No standard approach," she says.
But improving outcomes for opioid-dependent babies will clearly require more than just educating hospital staff.
Dr. Elisha Wachman teaches pediatrics at Boston University . She says providing this kind of care can be a big adjustment for hospitals.
"It really depends on the capacity of the hospital and where they house the babies for monitoring," Wachman says. "Some of them don't have room for the mothers to stay with the babies."
Compounding the problem, the matter of exactly what are the "best practices" is far from settled.
For example, new research suggests that for newborns methadone may be a better recovery drug than morphine, which Wachman says is most often used, even though doctors are still unsure about morphine's long-term effects.
"There's very few high-quality clinical trials that have been done in this population of infants," Wachman says. "If you can imagine, this is an incredibly difficult population to study. To do a randomized, controlled trial, for instance, of opiates and neonates is incredibly challenging."
Jackson acknowledges the challenges, but she says establishing consistent practices based on what doctors do know is an important first step toward getting answers.
When Lili was born, Victoria says she did everything she could to help her daughter get healthy in the hospital, with no idea whether the newborn would be taken from her and placed in protective custody.
"I was trying not to be connected with her, because, I thought, they're probably going to take her," Victoria says. "I haven't been clean that long. So I was trying to not, like, be in love with her. But I was so in love with her." Lili is her fourth child.
Victoria continues to show state officials that she is committed to staying off drugs. She has been allowed to raise Lili at Amethyst Place , a recovery home in Kansas City.
Lili is now a 16-month old girl who shares her mother's blonde hair, bright eyes and big smile. Despite her difficult start in life, the toddler is in good health, and her mom has been drug-free for a more than a year and a half.

AUDIE CORNISH, HOST:
Earlier this week, President Trump put on a display of some executive second guessing. First he publicly signed a massive annual defense policy bill. And then hours later, the White House quietly issued what's known as a signing statement. That signing statement lists more than 50 things the president does not like about the bill. Other presidents have done the same. But as NPR's David Welna reports, Trump may be outdoing his predecessors.
DAVID WELNA, BYLINE: It's extremely unusual that Congress passes and gets signed into law the annual defense policy bill so early in the year, something which minority leader Chuck Schumer noted today on the Senate floor.
(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)
CHUCK SCHUMER: I want to take a moment to thank a colleague who is not here today to celebrate that fact - Senator John S. McCain, for whom the bill has been named.
WELNA: On Monday, when President Trump signed that bill in front of troops at Fort Drum in upstate New York, he pointedly omitted from the bill's title the name of McCain, a frequent critic of Trump who has brain cancer.

PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: The National Defense Authorization Act is the most significant investment in our military and our war fighters in modern history, and I am very proud to be a big, big part of it.
WELNA: But in the signing statement released that night, Trump repudiated many parts of that bill as encroachments on his presidential powers. John Bellinger was a legal adviser in the George W. Bush White House. He says Trump's objections are similar to those made by other presidents but with one major difference.
JOHN BELLINGER: Simply the sheer number of them in this signing statement. I do think this is probably the largest number of provisions that I have ever seen a president object to - more than 50 provisions that the president has singled out. Most presidents don't usually bother to complain about every minor constitutional slight.
WELNA: Bellinger says that may be due in part to the White House not exercising much oversight with the Justice Department lawyers who drafted the signing statement.
BELLINGER: But the long list may also reflect even more that Congress is doing more to direct and restrict President Trump's actions in the foreign policy and defense areas.
WELNA: Many of the measures Trump's at odds with involve Russia, including one that bars the U.S. from recognizing Moscow's claim of sovereignty over Crimea. Other objections have been made before. Trump repeated almost verbatim President Obama's disapproval of Congress blocking the transfer of prisoners out of the U.S. prison in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. Hina Shamsi of the American Civil Liberties Union says the two men clearly had very different motives.
HINA SHAMSI: It doesn't appear that President Trump is making these assertions for some of the reasons that President Obama was. Even though President Obama was ineffectual in closing Guantanamo, President Obama recognized that it needed to be closed, whereas President Trump has the opposite view.
WELNA: The signing statement reads as if Trump intends to skirt the law, but former White House legal adviser Bellinger says that document does not empower the president to do so.
BELLINGER: It's really just a president's way of putting Congress on notice that he's got a concern about a particular provision so that if he actually does something later to not fully comply with a statutory provision, he can say later, look; I told you I had a problem with it.
WELNA: Trump of course could have vetoed the entire defense bill if he truly had so many problems with it, but doing so could pit him against fellow Republicans who passed those measures and who may well override a veto. In the year and a half he's been in office, Trump has yet to veto any bill Congress has sent him. David Welna, NPR News, Washington.
