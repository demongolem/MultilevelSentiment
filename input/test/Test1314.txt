I just didn&rsquo;t quite have the feel to hit those really soft shots.&rdquo;<br />Koepka, who also won this year&rsquo;s U.S. Open, was rewarded for his typically aggressive approach off the tee. Starting on the back nine, the highlight of his round was an eagle at the par-five 17th.<br />&ldquo;I like being able to hit driver on most holes and if you put it in position you can have some wedges in here and take advantage of your length,&rdquo; he said.<br />&ldquo;And I did that pretty well today. A few misses in the rough but these fairways aren&rsquo;t exactly wide so I don&rsquo;t expect to hit them all.&rdquo;<br />At the 17th hole, Koepka picked up five strokes on playing companion Johnson, who ran up a triple bogey after a wild hook off the tee.<br />&ldquo;The triple was just so bad,&rdquo; said Johnson. &ldquo;I hit that 70 yards left of where I was looking.<br />&ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t hit that shot in a long time, so it was kind of funny. Wasn&rsquo;t funny when I made a triple though.&rdquo;<br />Johnson fought back and almost had a hole in one at the par-three sixth where his ball lipped out of the hole.<br />Joint leader Lovemark could hardly have wished for a better start with birdies at the first three holes.<br />&ldquo;Good way to start, kind of lost it in the middle of the round and then found some good stuff coming in,&rdquo; said the 30-year-old, who entered the playoffs ranked 86th.<br />The top 125 players in the FedExCup standings were eligible for the first of four playoff events that culminate with a 30-player field for the Sept. 20-23 Tour Championship at East Lake Golf Club in Atlanta.<br />Reporting by Frank Pingue in Toronto; Additional reporting by Andrew Both in Cary, North Carolina; Editing by Ed Osmond/Peter Rutherford<br />Our Standards:<br /
