Grahamsville Little World's Fair is a big deal Thursday Aug 16, 2018 at 2:54 54 PM By Brenda GilhoolyFor the Times Herald-Record
Let go of the laptop, ignore the Instagram and conceal your cellphone, even if just for a few hours this weekend. Instead, savor some old-fashioned country-time fun at the Grahamsville Little World's Fair.
At 139 years, this is the longest running independent fair in New York. The three-day event features agricultural and livestock exhibits and contests, live music and demonstrations, rides, food, games and vendors.
There are a few new attractions this year, but "we try to keep the popular traditions going," says Nicole Gorr of the Neversink Agricultural Society, which hosts the fair.
Fan favorites include a vintage garden-tractor show and parade, classic-car show, draft-horse pull and tug-of-war and watermelon-eating contests.
The fair also offers magic shows, Bessie Bingo, 4-H presentations, agricultural and livestock exhibits and contests (rabbits, horses, alpacas, poultry and goats among them), arts and crafts (including needlework, stained glass, candlewicking and quilting) and fireworks.
You won't go hungry. Food choices include strawberry shortcake, cookies, watermelon, gyros, hotdogs and burgers, barbecue, ice cream, waffle sundaes, funnel cakes and a pie auction. The Neversink Farmers Market will be onsite, as well. Portuguese food is a new addition to the menu this year, Gorr says.
Also new this year is a Superhero Fun Run, in which kids can come dressed as their favorite superhero, dash around the fair and earn awards. Kids also may participate in scavenger hunts with prizes at the end.
For animal lovers, Nature Nick's Animal Adventures brings an educational wildlife show. The Flying High Dogs perform a variety of Frisbee and other entertaining tricks in several shows throughout the weekend. Be sure to meet Neil the Rooster, who lost his feet to frostbite and is the process of standing tall using 3-D printed prosthetics created by Sullivan County 4-Hers and Hurleyville Makers Lab.
Music includes Hillbilly Parade playing country cover songs, Thunder Ridge, Albi, White Wedding and Fast Forward.
There are also about 15 rides and a midway with games, which are not included in the price of admission. Fireworks begin at 9:30 p.m. Saturday.
And when the grownups need some time to themselves, they can head to the Catskill Brewery beer garden. Never miss a story
