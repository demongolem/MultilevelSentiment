New BioLogiQ blend with PBAT demonstrates marine biodegradable properties 16.08.2018 Iowa Falls, USA-based BioLogiQ, Inc., a bioplastic resin manufacturing company specializing in renewably-resourced plastic products, announced today that test results show its NuPlastiQ MB BioPolymer, produced by blending NuPlastiQ GP with PBAT (polybutylene adipate terephthalate), is marine biodegradable.
Performed by Eden Research Laboratory, results show 97% biodegradation of a GP/PBAT film in ocean water within a one-year period, according to ASTM-D6691 standards for marine biodegradability.The key to this innovative new plastic compound is BioLogiQ's NuPlastiQ GP General Purpose BioPolymer. GP is a 100% natural, renewably-resourced, plant-based resin that has been certified by TUV Austria to marine biodegrade in 28 days. When PBAT is mixed with NuPlastiQ GP, it will also biodegrade in marine environments.According to Brad LaPray, president and founder of BioLogiQ, successfully producing a marine biodegradable film using a material that was previously not marine biodegradable is a huge technical accomplishment that can significantly reduce both plastic marine debris and the negative effects of this debris in the oceans."Given the current concern regarding plastics and ocean pollution, we are working on NuPlastiQ MB marine biodegradable formulations of NuPlastiQ GP with polyethylene and polypropylene.," he said. "Our target applications are drink cups, straws, lids, and grocery sacks."When asked about certifying the new resin, Mr. LaPray said that, "The ability for plastics to biodegrade in a marine environment is so new and unusual that acceptable certification standards do not exist. We plan to work with industry and governments to develop new standards.
