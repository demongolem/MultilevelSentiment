Five ways you can learn computer code and get involved with Africa Code Week Five ways you can learn computer code and get involved with Africa Code Week Ready, set, code! Bigger and better, SAP Africa Code Week returns to spread digital literacy across the continent and aims to empower +600,000 children and youth in October this year. Here's how you can get involved.
LAGOS, Nigeria, 16th August 2018 -/African Media Agency (AMA)/- Fact: Did you know that by 2020, 80 percent of all jobs will be related to science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM)? By then, Africa would also have added 122 million younger people to its workforce, the most of any region in the world. This will provide the continent with the opportunity to be the fastest-growing digital consumer market on the planet, supported by the most youthful population. To build this educated workforce, children & youth must be provided the opportunity to acquire digital skills from a very young age. This is what led SAP to give birth to Africa Code Week (ACW) and work closely with UNESCO YouthMobile, Google, Governments, educational institutes, schools, businesses, Tech-Hubs, Start-Ups and NPOs to drive sustainable learning impact and make digital skills a core pillar of basic education across Africa. In partnership with SAP these stakeholders are joining forces to power opportunities through digital inclusion in support of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals- SDGs (#1 â€“ No Poverty, #4 â€“ Quality Education and #5 â€“ Gender Equality) through what Nelson Mandela described as "the most powerful weapon which we can use to change the world": education. With over 1.8 million youth introduced to coding over the past three years, ACW returns to the continent this year with a core focus on driving increased sustainability of the programme through its Train-the-Teacher sessions and female skills development in support of the #eskills4girls initiative, which was launched to help overcome the gender digital divide and promote education, skills and employment for girls and women in a digital world. In October 2018, ACW will support thousands of free workshops organized for youth aged 8-16 years across 36 African countries. Computer Coding, Artificial Intelligence, Data Science, Machine learning, Virtual Reality; the list of today's digital skillset is ever-evolving within a fast-paced digital economy. Whether a technophile or technophobe, here is how you can get involved in ACW; Attend a Live Workshop
Taking place at schools, universities, science centers or community centers, ACW's free digital workshops address specific age groups regardless of learner levels. Get yourself up to speed with fun learning tools and passionate teachers! Visit the ACW Map to locate a workshop near you.
1. Access a Free Online Course
Learn Coding from Scratch: If you are between 12 and 16 years old and would like to learn computer programming, openSAP is the place to start. This free online course will teach you how to create your own animations and games using the famous Scratch interface, a free programming language designed by the MIT Media Lab to simplify the face of coding for the young generation.
Teaching coding using Scratch: If you would like to learn the skills to teach youth coding using the famous Scratch interface described above, openSAP also has a free course for teachers.
* Both courses are also available in French on openSAP for teachers and youth in Francophone Africa.
2. Host a Coding Workshop in Your Community
Why not support the planning and execution of workshops in your own venue community? You can visit the ACW website to download your full partner guide including a checklist of what you'll need to host a successful coding workshop in your school or community.
3. Become a Coding Instructor
Use your teaching skills for the greater good and visit the ACW website to see where Train-the-Trainer workshops are taking place in your country. While ACW takes place over a one-week period every year, it is the local capacity building within schools and communities that will ensure sustainable 21st century skills development across the continent.
4. Become a Corporate Sponsor
ACW relies on a global network of likeminded companies. By becoming a sponsor, your organisation will be able to engage customers, partners and employees as skilled volunteers as part of its own series of workshops and help expand the scope to more African countries. You can reach out to info@africacodeweek.org for further details.
Together We Can Make the World Run Better
"There is so much we can do to empower our youth in the digital age," says Sunil Geness, Project Lead for Africa Code Week. "ACW creates awareness about the importance of digital skills through creative and interactive learning. It also fosters the rise and growth of a community training culture which supports Government and Education institutions with the integration of coding into existing school curricula."
He adds that it is not enough to rely on traditional teaching tools to equip our children with the skills they need for the future. "Beyond the activities taking place across the continent, Africa Code Week is also a fast-growing and powerful ecosystem that enables teachers and learners to connect and collaborate with their peers. This sustainable approach is a powerful contributor to realising the potential of Africa's immense talent pool."
