Why Monmouth game makes sense for Rutgers, plus 9 regional rivals who could be next Posted August 17, 2018 at 06:44 AM | Updated August 17, 2018 at 06:44 AM By James Kratch | NJ Advance Media for NJ.com
Rutgers and Monmouth are going to play a football game, and it makes sense for both sides.
You wouldn't know that, though, judged on the reaction from most Scarlet Knights fans following Thursday's announcement of the one-game deal between the in-state schools for the 2020 season opener at HighPoint.com Stadium in Piscataway.
The Hawks, who are coming off their first-ever trip to the FCS playoffs, have locked in a matchup they've desired for years and a chance to test themselves against the big school 34 miles up the road. Their fans are ready to roll.
Rutgers has granted Monmouth that shot, and also added a game that fits its scheduling strategy without breaking the bank, But there has still been plenty of grumbling from some corners.
Here's a closer look at why this game was a smart move for both sides , as well as what other regional opponents could be next for Rutgers as it fills out future schedules: ash-hobbs.jpg John Munson | NJ Advance Media for NJ.com PHILOSOPHY:
Head coach Chris Ash and athletics director Patrick Hobbs want to focus on regional rivalries in non-conference scheduling. Boston College, Syracuse and Temple are all on the schedule over the next few seasons, and now Monmouth is as well. There will likely be others to come, with some potential names mentioned below.
Rutgers believes that is the approach it needs to build the program up, bolster recruiting and generate interest. Fans may be upset about future series with Miami and UCLA being canceled , but Rutgers is not recruiting nationally at this point, and it doesn't need to overly extend itself while already struggling for wins in the Big Ten East. There's a difference between scheduling good games you can compete in and cupcakes, and Rutgers seems to be accomplishing the former for now. COST:
When you play in the Big Ten, getting paycheck games â€“ that is, the 1-2 non-conference home games every fall that are not against another Power 5 program â€“ is big business. And it's always getting bigger.
By the end of the 2018 season, Rutgers will have paid a combined $3.86 million for games against Buffalo, Eastern Michigan, New Mexico and Texas State. It is scheduled to pay out another $2.3 million in 2019 to play Liberty and UMass. And costs aren't going down anytime soon â€“ only up.
It's not a terribly sustainable approach for any school, much less one like Rutgers, which faces some financial challenges as it awaits full member status in the Big Ten in 2021. The Monmouth game will cost $375,000 â€“ a major discount compared to the other games. Absent long-term scheduling pacts between leagues that corral the market, pretty soon every major program is going to take an FCS game when it can get it, just to keep costs down. The Big Ten may also have to let its members schedule one each season again â€“ the SEC does it, and it's doing just fine. monmouth-footballjpg-d7c81380ef9fc23a.jpg Saed Hindash | For lehighvalleylive.com INTEREST:
Can anyone argue there won't be more juice to Rutgers-Monmouth than Rutgers-Texas State or Rutgers-Morgan State?
It's the first-ever meeting between two in-state schools. It will be the first time Rutgers has played another New Jersey school in 40 years. There will be Monmouth fans and students in the stadium â€“ something you rarely get for non-conference games of this sort. The Hawks will come up Route 18 ready to shock the world and make a name for themselves. Rutgers will feel a little pressure knowing it better show up, or else.
It's going to be much more exciting than your run-of-the-mill season opener against Flyover State U. There will be some tension and intrigue. That's a good thing for college football. HOW IT HAPPENED:
The Big Ten allows schools to play an FCS game in seasons where it only has four conference home games. But Rutgers has five Big Ten games at home in 2020. So what gives?
There was no formal measure taken, but the conference allowed Rutgers to move forward with scheduling the game because it will not play an FCS opponent in 2019, when it is eligible to do so, and it does not plan to fill its last open spot on the 2021 schedule with an FCS opponent. That means the earliest Rutgers is expected to play another FCS game is 2023. In the meantime, the Scarlet Knights will need to find a 12th game for the 2021 season â€“ that game will either be in mid-September or early October.
Here's a look at some of the regional teams Rutgers could look to add for that slot and others to come (one note: It does not sound like Rutgers will pursue matchups with triple-option teams like Army and Navy at this time)
