Random restarts seldom occur to high-end devices especially the new ones. Nonetheless, it can happen and in fact has already occurred to some high-powered smartphones including the Huawei P10. Usually the symptom is attributed to memory problems like when the memory is shrinking. But in new devices, errant apps and data corruption are usually the underlying causes. Random reboots on the Huawei P10 will likely occur when triggered by the latter factors. And should that be the case, end-users would be able to fix the problem at home. If you've landed into this page while searching for some inputs on how to deal with the same issue on your Huawei P10 smartphone, then you can refer to the given solutions below. These are potential solutions that are easy to perform.
Before anything else, if you have other issues with your device, try to browse through our as we've already addressed several issues with this device. Odds are that we've already published a post that tackles similar problems. Try finding issues that have similar symptoms with what you currently have and feel free to use the solutions we've suggested. If they don't work for you or if you still need our help, then fill up our questionnaire and hit submit to contact us. First solution: End all background apps.
Background apps are apps you've recently opened but not closed. Technically, these apps are in standby mode and they're still running. While keeping background apps may benefit you in terms of multitasking or reloading of same apps, there are factors that can cause them to crash. When this happens, there's a tendency that the overall system functions of the phone get affected. Thus, performance issues would begin to surface. Random reboots could be among the transpiring symptoms. To clear this out, ending all background apps is recommended. Here's how to end or quit background apps on your Huawei P10: Tap the Recent Apps key from the Home screen. Tap the Active apps icon. Tap End next to an app to quit individual apps. If you see multiple apps running in the background, you can end them all at once by tapping on the End all button. Tap OK to confirm action.
Try to use your device as you normally do, without any background apps running. If it still reboots by itself, then continue to troubleshoot and try the next solution. Second solution: Reboot/force restart your Huawei P10.
A soft reset or device restart effectively gets rid of random software errors and minor glitches. It also rectifies errant apps and dumps corrupted cache and temporary data that may have inflicted adverse symptoms on the device. If you haven't done it yet, then follow these steps to soft reset your Huawei P10: Press the Power button for a few seconds until the menu options appear. Select Power Off option then tap OK . After 30 seconds, press and hold the Power button until the device restarts.
Alternatively, you can carry out a force restart with these steps: Press and hold the Volume Down button and Power button for about 10 to 20 seconds until the phone reboots.
A force restart is an alternative method to reboot a frozen device. It's a simulated battery removal procedure for devices with non-removable batteries. It works the same a the usual reboot but carried out using the physical buttons. Both a soft reset and force restart won't cause data loss for as long as it's properly done. Third solution: Boot in safe mode and diagnose apps.
In safe mode, only the stock apps or preinstalled apps are permitted to run as third-party apps are bypassed. This allows you to easily determine if the problem is triggered by a third-party app or not. To enable safe mode on your Huawei P10, simply follow these steps: Press the Power button to turn off your device. After a few seconds, press and hold the Power button to turn it back on. When you see the Huawei animation screen, quickly press the Volume Down button until the lock screen.
You should then see a Safe Mode label at the bottom left corner of the screen. Use your phone as you normal do while in safe mode and see if it reboots by itself. If the problem does not occur while running your phone in safe mode, a third-party app is likely inflicting it. To fix the problem, delete or uninstall the app you suspect is causing the symptom. You may have to uninstall individual apps starting from the one you downloaded recently or before your device started to experience random reboots. Fourth solution: Update apps and phone software to the latest version.
A fix patch may be needed if bugs and malware have triggered the symptom to occur on your phone. Software updates are rolled out periodically to add new features and security enhancements to certain devices. If you haven't yet updated your Huawei P10, check for new software update available with these steps: Tap Settings from the Home screen. Tap System . Scroll to and tap System update . Tap the button to Check for Updates . Doing so will prompt your device to check for updates. If an update is available, you will see the complete details on the following screen. To install the new software version, tap the Quick Update button.
Wait until the device is finished download and installing the update. When the update is completely installed, reboot your phone to apply the new system changes and prevent apps or phone system from acting up.
Aside from Android update, it's also imperative to install pending updates for your apps. Errant apps can also cause your phone to succumb into random restarts. Keeping apps up-to-date will prevent this from occurring. Unless you've set your device and apps to auto-install updates, you will need to manually check for and install pending updates available for your apps. Here's how: Open the Play Store or Google Play app. Tap the Menu icon. Navigate to My Apps & Games. Tap the Update button next to each app to update individual apps. If you want to enable auto-updates for an app, tap the three vertical dots on the upper right corner next to the app's name and then mark the checkbox next to Auto-update.
Reboot your phone as soon as all apps are finished updating. Doing so will ensure all new changes are properly applied. Fifth solution: Wipe cache partition on your Huawei P10.
Corrupted cache from system folders are also among the culprits. Like individual apps, the phone also stores cache or temporary system data on system folders or cache partition. If any of these data becomes corrupted, system functions will also be affected. To prevent this from happening, wiping cache partition is recommended. Doing so will clear all cache files from the phone system including those that were corrupted. Here's how it's done: Turn your phone completely off. Press and hold the Power button and the Volume Up button simultaneously for a few seconds. When you see the Huawei logo , release both buttons. You will then be routed to the EMUI or Android Recovery menu with a few options to choose from. Press the Volume Down button to scroll to and highlight Wipe cache partitio n from the given options. Then press the Power button to confirm selection. Wait until your device is done wiping the cache partition and once it's done, the Reboot system now option will be highlighted. Press the Power button to confirm and reboot your phone.
You should notice your phone to have better and faster performance after the wiping cache and data from the system cache partition. Random reboots should also be gone by now unless a more complex system error or hardware damage is causing it. Other options Remove any microSD card from the phone. If you have any SD card inserted, try to remove it then see how your phone works with an SD card. Many smartphone users who encountered the same issue later found out that the random restarts are attributed to a bad SD card. Some data stored on the card or the SD card itself may have been corrupted and eventually caused the phone system to act up. To rule this out, eject the SD card then remove it. Factory data reset/master reset. A full system reset can potentially fix the problem if tough bugs are the main trigger. Fatal system errors might have caused your device to crash and reboot by itself. Repair/Service. Take your device to a service center and have it diagnosed by an authorized technician. Hardware damage can be the worst possible trigger of random reboots among smartphones. If this is what's causing the same trouble on your Huawei P10 smartphone, then repair would be necessary.
