I don't know how many people ran on the pitch from their side of things, and around the referee and the linesman and the fourth official.<br />'And then the scenes I saw at half-time (in the tunnel) around the referee were interesting from all and sundry on their side.<br />'And then things change in the second half and you are left scratching your head.'<br />Dyche said of the incident where Gibson was sent off: 'I've seen it - it's his hip first when he gets a block, and then it's his hand second, and that is deemed a professional handball if you like and then a second yellow, and he is sent off, and I think we are all left scratching our heads at that moment.'<br />The Clarets now have a huge fight on their hands to reach the Europa League after the loss<br />He added: 'I think you all saw the feel of the game was different in the second half.

But for me the bigger thing for me was out on the pitch, because we're told not to do that.'<br />Dyche was frustrated with the number of people talking to the referee in the tunnel<br />RELATED ARTICLES<br /
