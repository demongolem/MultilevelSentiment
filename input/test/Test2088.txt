Please Rate Indian batsmen need to look ugly and dirty and show some grit if India had to turn the tide in the series against England, said Ravi Shastri, the head coach of the Indian cricket team ahead of the third test against England. Indian batsmen need to look ugly and dirty and show some grit if India had to turn the tide in the series against England, said Ravi Shastri, the head coach of the Indian cricket team ahead of the third test against England. Shastri also said that Indian captain Virat Kohli is feeling much better after being troubled by a back issue during the second test match. He said that Kohli is moving well in the nets and imprving by the day. With Dinesh Karthik's dismal run with the bat, speculation has been rife about whether Rishabh Pant will be given a go. However, Shastri did not specify as to who will be standing behind the stumps in the third Test for India against England at Trent Bridge. "About Rishabh Pant you will know at 11 o'clock day after," he said. 'Rahane remain a pillar' Shastri also backed under-fire batsman Ajinkya Rahane saying it was not fair to single out any one player. He said that batsmen from both teams have struggled in the series and it is a case of mental resolve. Shastri said that Rahane will remain one of India's pillars. He said that the conditions have been tough for batting, but added that is where character comes in. He said that Indian bastmen must be ready to leave a lot of balls and prepare to look ugly and dirty and show some grit. He welcomed the return of Ben Stokes to the England side calling him a terrific cricketer. Shastri said that India like to play against top cricketers. "If it is cleared by courts, what is the reason for him not to play? If I was the coach, I would have played him," he said. Tactical error Ravi Shastri admitted that going with two spinners for the Lord's test was an tactical error. "Then again, we didn't know how much it would rain, whether a match would go into the final day and spinners would have come handy. But in hindsight, the amount of rain, the amount of time we lost, seamer could have been a better option," he said. Shastri also expressed his sadness at the news of the passing away of former India captain Ajit Wadekar. "On behalf of the whole Indian cricket team, we would like to offer condolences to his family. I knew Ajit very well from a very young age, lived in the same building as I do. All I say is he was one of our finest captains, a great man manager and as shrewd as anyone will get as a captain." India are 2-0 down in the five-match series and need to win at Trent Bridge to stay alive in the series
