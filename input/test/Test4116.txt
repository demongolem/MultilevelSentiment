Dudley optician looks to the future By Kelly Harris @DudleyNews1 Senior Reporter Hussnan Ejaz 0 comment SINCE carrying out work experience at a Dudley opticians, Hussnan Ejaz has had his heart set on a career in optics. Now, nine years later he's fulfilled his dream and is an optometrist and director of the same store where he first started out.
Born and bred in Dudley, Hussnan left sixth form at 18 and was offered work experience at Specsavers on Castle Street.
He immediately loved the work and quickly took up the opportunity of a role at the store as an optical assistant.
Keen to progress and recognising a passion for optics and for helping people, Hussnan went on to study optometry at Anglia Ruskin University, continuing to work part-time at Specsavers Dudley while he studied.
Graduating in 2014, Hussnan returned to full time employment at the store to carry out his pre-registration year, qualifying as an optometrist in 2015.
In just 12 months he was promoted to lead optometrist, managing the other six optometrists in the store.
But his career journey didn't stop there.
"I knew that ultimately I wanted to be a store director as well as an optician," he said.
"I craved extra responsibility, and despite people thinking I was too young or it was too soon I kept telling myself anything is possible."
To support his journey Hussnan joined the Institute of Leadership and Management and completed a course to help him develop his management skills.
He then went on to do the Specsavers Pathway course; a development programme that trains prospective Joint Venture Partners (JVPs).
After completing the course in 2017, was invited to become a director of a new Specsavers store opening in Blackheath.
"I was honoured to have this opportunity to help run the sister store to Specsavers Dudley," added Hussnan.
"As well as supporting customers in the test room, the role of director also challenges my commercial and people management skills too."
Recently, Hussnan was asked to also become a director of Specsavers Dudley, completing his lifelong ambition.
"It's great to be a director of the store here in Dudley," he said.
"I've never worked anywhere else and have never wanted to, and to be here now helping to lead the business is fantastic.
"Supporting the local community, where I live, is something I'm very passionate about. And this along with my knowledge and understanding of the store and the team helps ensure that I can offer an empathetic and supportive approach.
"I'm now really looking forward to working with my fellow directors at Blackheath and Dudley to build on the success of the stores and ensure the very best in eyecare for all our customers.
