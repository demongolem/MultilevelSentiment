Suzanne is one of the most amazing people we've met in 2018. Her passion for helping causes is boundless. Check out her interview below.
Hi, Suzanne! Thank you for granting the interview. We are thrilled to learn more about "Teal Soldiers." We know it is a charity film that raises awareness of ovarian cancer. Tell us how you got the role and the character you play.
Teal Soldiers was my most challenging role to date, and I knew it would be from the start. That's partly what attracted me to the script and the role. That and the fact that this was a charity film for such a worthy cause. So many people have been affected by cancer either directly or indirectly, including myself, and I wanted to be apart of a film that sent an important message to viewers and raised awareness. My character, Tiana, gets diagnosed with ovarian cancer. The film follows her journey as she deals with the diagnosis, her treatment plan & the friendships she makes along the way.
How important is it for the film industry to get involved with charities, such as this one?
If you have a platform to create art and you can do it to bring awareness to a worthy cause, then do it!
There are so many issues going on in the world and a lot of people don't know the facts or truly understand the issue. Film is a great platform to get involved and tell a story about something you truly believe in. If you can make a film and make a positive difference at the same time, then why not?!

Tell us what the audience should expect?
A film filled with love, pain, and determination. If you have been affected by cancer in your life, then at least a little of this film, or maybe even all of it will resonate with you. Tiana's journey can be really confronting to the viewer, but it's also inspirational & hopeful. So go in with an open mind and an open heart.
Why should people watch "Teal Soldiers?"
Watch it for the love that went into making this film! Everyone on this project donated their time and their talent. Weekends were spent on set, and that doesn't even include the time for the pre & post-production. We all did it because we knew it was for such a good cause! So if you believe in the cause and want to support it, give it a view. Help spread the message.
Let's talk about your role in "Burns Point." Tell us about your role and character.
I was so happy to land a role in "Burns Point" as I really wanted to work with the director, Tim Blackburn. I think I ended up auditioning for three different roles on that feature film. One in the room and two self-tests. They ended up casting me in a completely different role, but that's what I love about acting. Sometimes the pieces don't fit, but there are those few times that all the pieces fit perfectly and you're meant to be on a production! I ended up playing the role of the girl who works at a bowling alley. I'm only in one scene, but it was a great scene, and so well written and I had such a ball doing itâ€¦ no pun intended!
You also do choreography work. Name some of your favorite features.
I love choreographing and at the moment, I guess you can say it is my 'day job'. I think choreography and dance is a form of self-expression and I couldn't imagine my life without it. I love choreographing all styles, but my favorite is tap. It's so intricate and rhythmical and I love how you can honestly do it to any style of music. I have just finished choreographing a routine for 'Dancers Fight Cancer' â€“ a dance concert raising money for the Cancer Council. I also do a lot of choreography and work with different styles of dance for Dreamworld. Dreamworld has not only given me the opportunity to choreograph shows, but also create & direct them. So I feel very grateful to constantly be creating.
How can fans-to-be gain access to you socially?
Instagram all the way!
Who are your biggest industry influencers and why?
The people that have influenced me the most in this industry are definitely the people I have come across who have been doing it a very long time, but still, hold that passion and love for the work. They always have and always will put in the hard yards for their career, no matter how far along they are. They really embody everything this industry is about to me and inspire me to be the best actor I can be.
I often get inspired and influenced when I watch films as well. For example, I saw a short film, "Slapper" directed by Luci Schroder at the Melbourne International Film Festival a few years back. The film is so raw & edgy; it opened my eyes and forced me to look at another angle of society. It inspired me for a TV series I'm currently writing â€“ so thanks Luci Schroder for the inspiration! Hopefully one day we can collaborate on something together! Behind the scenes shot from 'Teal Soldiers' with Director, Jonathan Creed
When looking back on your career, what resonated with you the most and why?
I feel like my career has been, I'm not going to say small, but I will say very short lived so far for what I would like to achieve. You have to remember to celebrate the little wins in this industry because they can be few and far in between and you need to appreciate them! I honestly feel like what resonated with me was getting the role, Tiana, in 'Teal Soldiers' . At that moment in my life, I was offered a full-time job, one that would pull me away from performing or allow the time for my acting. I told myself I would take the job if I didn't get the role in 'Teal Soldiers '. I felt as though I was meant to play that role from the moment I read the character description and it took a few auditions, but I did secure the role! I felt like it was a character I needed to play, not just as an actor, but also as a person. By playing the role of Tiana, I could honor the person in my life that had been affected by cancer & understand their journey more.
In your opinion, how could talent make an impact on the world?
You don't have to make a movie & raise money for a charity to make an impact. You can do something as simple as being kind, generous and having patience with people.
I do think that some actors have a fairly generous following on social media & if you are one of those people, why not use that power to spread a positive message every now and then. You could promote body positivity, cruelty-free products that you love or talk about a charity that you truly believe in! It doesn't have to be fake or forced, just genuine things that could impact people in a positive way.
If you had to do it all over again, would you still choose this career? Would you do anything differently?
I will always remember something one of my favorite acting teachers has said beforeâ€¦" if you can imagine yourself doing anything else at all, choosing any other career, then do it." He wasn't saying this to make people second guess their talent, he was saying it because he was being completely truthful and real with us. This industry is for the long haul, it is full of ups and downs and highs and lows and it can be so challenging. You have to go in knowing that. That being said, I couldn't imagine myself being completely fulfilled if I did anything else. Being creative is an outlet for me and the more creative I find myself being, the more creative jobs come my way!
Do you have anything else you would like to share about your career?
I'd just like to say thank you to everyone that's ever supported me and those people that have stood by me in my journey so far. And to all those people who have ever cast me or even brought me into the audition room, I'm so grateful because my successes in this industry couldn't have happened without those moments of opportunity. Also, keep your eye out because I'm writing a TV series that raises awareness about another issue in Australia. I'm really excited about the prospects of where this project could go, so fingers crossed for that. Andâ€¦ if you've read until this point, thank you for taking the time to check out what I have to say! Remember it's never too late to chase your dreams and follow your creative path, go for it!
