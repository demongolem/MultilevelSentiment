Meet the Super Squad. The team that helps the Canberra Raiders see green before the Viking clap kicks off at every home game.
They're a group of 8-12 from the 70 volunteers who help out every time the Raiders play at home.
Setting up balloons and banners of players past and present in the locker rooms, the player's race, the member's lounges and around Canberra Stadium as well.
Some have autism. Some have other disabilities. But they all help inspire the Green Machine.

David Campion loves the part he's played in the first season of the Super Squad.
"We do all of the volunteering stuff, we put the banners up on game day. We do all the stuff that the general public never sees. I love it," he said.
"It's a pretty good foundation that Ricky has actually got. We get to wear our own jerseys with our names on them."
Raiders game day manager Tayla Shields was blown away by how much the squad has grown this season.
Not to mention how quickly they set up the ground and the hours they save the Raiders every week.
"They love it, they've made so many friends from it. Their confidence has just skyrocketed," Shields said.
"A lot of the members are actually in year 12 as well so this is helping them with future work opportunities down the track.
"They are so loved by us, as well as Rick and the players. They've had a few opportunities now to come to the captain's runs and they just help out wherever they can."
Loading The idea was born through a company called Donkey Wash , run by Super Squad member Sam Agyemang, which was washing the players' gym towels.
Raiders marketing manager Jason Mathie said it gave them the idea to reach out to some carers in the Canberra community to start recruiting a crew.
It also fits in with the work Stuart does off the field with his own charity, which built a second respite house this year to help families live with autism.
But more importantly, Mathie said the squad was also enriching the Raiders' staff lives as well.
"It's really cool, they're just awesome," he said.
"We find it very rewarding, I know personally I do, and it's something I look forward to each and every week leading into the games."
