3D printing - preparing 3D files for 3D printing , full review and modify as necessary
Preferably you are a 3D modeler or engineer familiar with 3D SLS printing
You will receive 3D OBJ files intended for 3D printing, the products are designed (broken down) into many parts to fit inside 3D printer chambers which are later connected for assembly
You will review and prepare them for 3D printing as follows:
1. Ascertain the measurements and tolerances are viable and accurate
2. Ascertain structural rigidity/integrity
3. Prepare the individual parts for easy glue-less connections ("snap into position"), no adhesives
4. Review finishes to meet prerequisites; sanding, painting and/or electroplating options
5. Prepare individual HP STL files with full smooth surface topology
6. Prepare (stack) the STL files/plates for max utilization of the 3D printer's printing chamber (maximum parts per run)
7. Modify/change as per the results of the initial print (test run)
8. Prepare final files and assembly instructions (BOM)
