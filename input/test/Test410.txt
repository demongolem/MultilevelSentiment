Video Image Aust bid for 2021 Women's Rugby World Cup 1:26 August 8, 2018. Rugby Australia chief Raelene Castle speaks to the media in Sydney on Wednesday. Castle said she is confident of delivering a record-breaking women's Rugby World Cup, if Australia wins hosting rights for the 2021 tournament. The bid will be submitted on Friday with the World Rugby Council expected to announce the successful applicant in November. Castle felt NSW and Australia's track record in hosting major sports events would stand the bid in good stead. "The confidence to raise the commercial support and governmental support is a really important part of our history," Castle said. "They (World Rugby) will have confidence that we are going to be able to deliver a successful tournament and really take the women's World Cup to the next level." Castle also said World Rugby had not committed to staging a women's World Cup in the southern hemisphere but she was upbeat. "They also understand the importance of making sure that the game develops right across the world, so I would expect that's a huge advantage for us," Castle said. (AAP Video/Iain Boyd).

AN all-female panel perfectly equipped to give the background and insight of the Wallaroos' ground-breaking Test match against the Black Ferns on Saturday.
Louise Ransome will sit in the Test match hosting chair for the first time in the pre-game show for the Australian women's match against New Zealand with former Wallaroo and 'Kick & Chase' regular Mollie Gray alongside her.

Gray moved into the media this year after being forced to retire with injury and said this panel, which also features former players Gemma Etheridge and Tiana Penitani in commentary, can give viewers a real understanding of the women's game.

"It's important to understand that the men and women's game are so different," Gray said.
"A lot of people when they watch a game of women's rugby at that Australian level go, 'Well that's nothing like the men's'. Well, no shit. They're not even part-time athletes, not even close. The boys are there day in, day out and get to work on their skills whereas the Wallaroos only come together a week before a Test match, so no wonder it's going to be different.
"It's really important when you've got women coming in who are able to commentate and be on the broadcast and we understand that.
"It's not about defending the players and their level of skill, it's more about giving people a really solid understanding of why the game is so different and that you're actually watching a really great game of women's rugby."

When it appeared women's XVs would remain the poor cousin to the flashier sevens following last year's women's World Cup, interest and investment has swung the other way in 2018.
Rugby Australia recently unveiled its bid to host the 2021 Women's World Cup and Super W began earlier this year.
Ransome has covered the different women's tournaments throughout the year and has seen what the women's game offers and is excited about the next chapter this weekend at ANZ Stadium.

"We worked at the Brisbane Tens tournament and the best match of the entire tournament was the women's final, it was unbelievable," she said.
"It was NSW vs Queensland and just big hits after big hits. I look back at that and think we put so much energy into that (broadcast) and the girls performed on the field and since then we've Super W, we're bidding for the World Cup and you have a double header Bledisloe for the first time in Australia.

"It's all really exciting and they're moving in the right direction."
Which is why Gray is confident this match will prove why it gets equal billing and is happy to be watching from the commentary box.
"It's not a curtain-raiser, it's a headliner and it's really important to distinguish between those two and it just goes to show where women's XVs is at, on their own platform," Gray said.
"They can pave their own path now. Everyone is really excited to play in front of their friends and family and it means a lot to everyone.
"On the other side, I'm just happy I get to be involved still. There's nothing worse than being forced to retire and it's been quite a struggle.
"I've been so enthusiastic about watching the girls all year but it's also been quite difficult to transition out of being a player and I was fortunate enough to somehow convince somebody to give me a job at Fox."
