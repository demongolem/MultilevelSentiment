Congress plenary session: Manmohan Singh's silence has done what BJP's uproar failed to do, says Sidhu
Many Pakistanis heartily welcomed Indian cricketer-turned-politician Navjot Singh Sidhu to their country on Twitter, only to realise that the tweet had come from an account that wasn't the Punjab Minister's. Reports said that Sidhu is expected to arrive in Pakistan on Friday for Imran Khan 's swearing-in on Saturday.
After Khan secured the most seats in the Pakistan general elections, he extended invitations to multiple Indian cricketers to attend his swearing-in ceremony. Sidhu had, in August, accepted the invitation, while others like Sunil Gavaskar and Kapil Dev chose not to attend.
On Friday, a parody account (@NavjotSingh_1) tweeted, "Leaving home to visit Pakistan. I'm very excited to see Imran Khan and I am very lucky that Imran Khan called me. [sic]". It's not entirely surprising that people were fooled by the tweet since Sidhu had earlier termed it a "great honour" to be invited, and said the Pakistan prime minister-in-waiting was a "man of character. There has been no tweet from Sidhu's actual handle (@sherryontopp) since January 2017. Leaving home to visit pakistan I'm very excited to see Imran Khan and i am very lucky that Imran Khan called me.
