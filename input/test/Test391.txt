BY STEVE BRANDON/PORTLAND TRIBUNE/Contenders hail from Scotland, Brazil, South Korea, Spain, Austria and more
NORTH PLAINS â€” A first-round leaderboard on the Web.com Tour can be a melting pot.
It was on Thursday at Pumpkin Ridge Golf Club.
Here is a sampling of players in strong contention â€” and chasing leader Derek Ernst â€” after 18 holes of the fifth annual WinCo Foods Portland Open:
â€¢ Jimmy Gunn, a 38-year-old Scot who learned the game from his grandfather at famed Royal Dornoch. He shot a 7-under-par 64 on the Witch Hollow course to trail Ernst by three shots and Texan Taylor Moore by one.
â€¢ Fernando Mechereffe, 35, who was born and raised in Brazil. He also shot 64 on Thursday.
â€¢ Sungjae Im, 20, of South Korea, who has led the tour in earnings all season. He had a 65.
â€¢ Gonzalo Fernandez-Castano, from Madrid, who is 37 and splits time on the Web.com Tour and European Tour. He shot 65.
â€¢ Sepp Straka, 25, from Vienna, Austria, who is a former Georgia Bulldog now living in Athens (Georgia, not Greece). He, too, had a 65.
In all, 71 players broke par on Thursday, with 10 at 66, eight at 67, 12 at 68 and 17 at 69.
Eight players in the top 10 after the first round are internationals. Players from six countries outside the U.S. have won on the tour this season: Argentina, Canada, England, Germany, Mexico and South Korea.
Gunn grew up in the Scottish Highlands and learned golf from his grandfather while spending summers with him, a prominent club golfer. Growing up, Gunn liked to watch Nick Faldo, largely because they share the same birthday (July 18). But while Gunn was good enough to win four club titles in a row at Royal Dornoch, he wasn't so much on a path to playing professionally. He would caddy at the club as well, and worked a couple of years on an oil rig and helping his father in carpentry.
One day, though, he caddied for some Americans who encouraged and would later support him in his quest. In 2007, Gunn turned pro and moved to Arizona to play the mini-tour.
"I've had to work hard," he said.
He "made a lot of putts" on Thursday. "It's hard not to on these greens," he said. "If you miss fairways here, you can't stop the ball on the greens. But if you hit the greens, you have a chance to make putts because the greens are so good."
Gunn didn't have a bogey on Thursday. Not bad for a guy still getting over a head cold â€”"must have picked up something on the flight from Kansas to San Francisco last week"â€” and ranking 125th on the tour money list.
Despite his relatively humble beginnings in golf, Gunn said he feels like "I'm as good" as his competitors. "I'm trying to get to the (Web.com Tour) playoffs, so this is a big week for me."
Merchereffe did something he had never done before â€” make three eagles in one round. And they all came on his first nine (the back nine). He reached the par-5 11th with a hybrid on his second shot and sank a 15-footer. He holed a 113yard wedge on the par-4 13th â€” the ball spun back into the cup. And, he chipped in from 30 yards and from just off the green on the par-5 18th.
The rest of the day, "was pretty normal," he said.
After a bogey on the 8th, he birdied the 9th to close on a high note.
Mechereffe moved to the United States at age 17 to play golf for North Carolina State.
He was one of the lucky ones in his home country, though.
"Golf is not very popular in Brazil. My parents just happened to play â€” on the only course in the city â€” so my brother and sister and I got to play, too," he said.
At age 13, Mechereffe began traveling around South America to compete in junior tournaments.
By the time he got to college age, he knew what he had to do.
"I knew that if I wanted to play with the best players, they were here (in the U.S.)," he said.
So he enrolled at N.C. State. A D V E R T I S I N G | Continue reading below
"I was afraid in the beginning â€” it was a big change in culture, and there was the language thing. But I'm glad I'm here now," he said.
Mechereffe is 5-8, 165. "I'm not one of the longer hitters, so I have to use my driver a lot and take chances off the tee," he said.
Now living in Memphis, he has been toiling away as a pro for years, chasing the dream of playing on the PGA Tour. At No. 122 on this year's Web.com Tour money list and yet to wind up higher than 17th in any event, the 2004 college grad with a wife and two children needs a big finish this week to get into the top 75, let alone the coveted top 25.
"You don't win a whole lot in golf. Golf beats you down on a regular basis," he said. "So you just have to believe in yourself and believe you're going to turn it around â€¦ you're always working, and you've got to keep punching and plugging along.
"With any tournament out here you get renewed hope that you might play great and your life may change by the end of the week."
Im is coming off a solid showing in the PGA Championship won last week by Brooks Koepka. Im tied for 42nd at 3-under. He seemed to take some momentum from that into his first round at Pumpkin Ridge â€” especially with his short game.
Im has a lead of about $100,000 atop the Web.com Tour money list and is in great position to finish in the top spot. If he maintains his pace, he'll break the tour record for consecutive weeks leading in earnings. He's at 22 weeks, with this week and four in the tour playoffs to go, and Michael Sim's record is 24.
Fernandez-Castano has seven European Tour victories, the most recent the 2013 BMW Masters, along with two on the Asian Tour. He's played in all four majors; in 2013, he tied for 20th at the Masters and 10th in the U.S. Open. He's been on the PGA Tour and is looking to get back to that level. He's No. 72 on the Web.com Tour money list this season.
"There's still 54 holes, a long way to go, but this was the start I was looking for," he said.
He said he's been pacing himself physically, not spending a lot of time practicing.
"I've been all over the world this year; the travel has been absolutely crazy, and I've been away from the family for a long time," he said. "I know I'm tired. I've played a lot. It's very important to know I can't do as much as in my 20s."
One thing he thinks he can do, though, is play well at Pumpkin Ridge.
"I lvoe this course," he said. "In my opinion, it's probably the best course we play all year.
"I love old-school courses, tree-lined courses and ones that test every aspect of your game.
"You can't ask for a better venue for our last regular event of the year. For me, this is second to none."
Notes
Former University of Oregon standout Wyndham Clark struggled to a 75. The former Pac-12 champion had an 8 on the par-4 6th hole. He was tied for 138th in the field of 156.
Clark is 14th on the season money list and assured of getting his PGA Tour card, however.
â€¢ Sam Burns, a 22-year-old former LSU star who is No. 2 on the money list behind Im, shot 69.
â€¢ One past champion is in the hunt in this year's WinCo Foods Portland. Carlos Ortiz, 27, of Mexico, shot 68.
â€¢ Mechereffe is only the second Web.com Tour player this year to make three eagles in one round. Erik Barnes did it in the El Bosque Mexico Championship.
â€¢ The Web.com Tour has had 19 first-time winners in 2018. Twelve players tied for 10th or better after Thursday are seeking their first title.
