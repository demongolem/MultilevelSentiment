Two of Nottinghamshire's prisons will be getting a share of Â£10 million to tackle ongoing issues with drugs, poor conditions and mobile phones inside struggling jails.
HMP Nottingham and HMP Ranby were two of 10 prisons chosen across the UK to receive a share of the funding launched by the Ministry of Justice.
Under the programme, governors at each prison will be provided with analysis of the drugs issues they face, allowing them to tackle high levels of usage among prisoners.
Each of the prisons will be provided with new scanners capable of spotting packages inside bodies, as well as sniffer dogs trained to detect new psychoactive substances (NPS).
Prisons Minister Rory Stewart said: "With more than 20,000 prison officers, 84,000 prisoners, and over 100 prisons, it is vital we set challenging standards so prisons are places where offenders can turn their lives around. Read More Where are you most likely to be a victim
"With the right leadership on the ground, and support from the centre, these 10 prisons will pave the way for a new approach, a new ethos and a new direction.
"No-one can hope to change an entire system overnight. But through these vital improvements to 10 prisons , we can set a course for the rest of the estate to follow â€“ leading us to a system that truly rehabilitates, cuts re-offending and ultimately keeps the public safer."
A total of Â£6 million has been put forward for physical security with drug-detection dogs, body-scanners and improved perimeter defences.
A further Â£3 million is to be spent on improving the fabric of the jails and new standards of cleanliness and decency. HMP Ranby
And Â£1 million will be put towards bespoke training programmes and interventions to give governors support with driving improvement.
It comes after a damning report into conditions at HMP Nottingham was released earlier this year.

He also suggested the conditions could be why a number of prisoners committed suicide in recent months.
The scheme will be up and running in all 10 prisons by the end of the year, with "tangible results" expected within 12 months.
Frances Crook, chief executive of the Howard League for Penal Reform, said: "Additional funding is always welcome for a public service that is as overburdened and under-resourced as the prison system, but the devil will be in the detail."It is disappointing to see that most of the money will be spent on locks, bolts and barbed wire.
"As the minister is aspiring to create 'centres of excellence' in ten prisons he should look at dynamic security, which is about building relationships and getting prisoners active. Nottingham Prison
"It looks as if ministers are yet again micro-managing governors by bureaucrats at the centre."Ultimately, the key to making prisons safer and more secure lies in reducing demand on the system. Read More Car went 'airborne' during high-speed police chase near Ilkeston
"Bold steps to reduce the prison population would save lives, protect staff and prevent more people being swept into deeper currents of crime, violence and despair.
"Ministers have made a start in recent announcements and this is the route to their centres of excellence, not barbed wire and a bucket of paint."
Geographical clusters of prisons in Yorkshire, the north Midlands and London were chosen for the project to ensure a targeted approach to tackling the supply of drugs from organised crime in the areas.
The 10 prisons selected for the programme are Hull, Humber, Leeds, Lindholme, Moorland, Wealstun, Nottingham, Ranby, Isis and Wormwood Scrubs.
Peter Dawson, director of the Prison Reform Trust, added: "The governors of the 10 prisons will be pleased to have a little more money, wherever it comes from." Like us on Faceboo
