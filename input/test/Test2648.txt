#HighTrends Where Is The Best Divorce Lawyer?
If perhaps you haven't already, chances are that sometime in your lifetime you will need to employ an attorney. Thanks to my interview with Tampa Lawyer Christina Mesa, listed here is a selection of answers to common as well as fundamental questions.
1. QUESTION: Do I need to hire an attorney at law in the county where the problem occurs?
ANSWER: No. Many lawyers practice in other counties and other states, based on their licensure for the latter. Having experience in the county wherein the matter will be litigated is essential as that attorney will have a comfort level with the neighborhood courthouse personnel, attorneys (likely opposing lawyer) and judges. One thing to consider in hiring an attorney outside the area wherein the matter takes place is cost of journey time. Some attorneys do not charge for travel, others give you a lowered rate or maintain a billable rate for all work performed. Discuss that question with each attorney consulted.
2. QUESTION: How may I make certain my attorney is working on my problems?
ANSWER: Every good lawyer monitors his time (fees) and expenditures (costs). Your retainer agreement should include a confirmation of how the lawyer bills his clients - in advancemonthly, quarterly, etc. You may even track your case in some jurisidictions that supply on-line access to case dockets. If the county has that set up, you're wise to often review the docket and see what changes have occurred by your counsel and the other party/counsel. Also feel at ease contacting your attorney at intervals to learn the status of the issue, knowing you will likely be billed for these communications.
3. QUESTION: Precisely how do I select an attorney or lawyer?
ANSWER: Legal matters are as vast as those in other sectors, such as medicine, construction, finance, etc. and can be just as complex. To protect your rights and remedies, the very best practice is to study your area of need and research what lawyers are available to work with you. A recommendation from somebody you know and respect can bring a personal element to the decision to hire an law firm but shouldn't be the singular reason counsel is selected. Look into the attorney's background of education, expertise and area(s) of practice. Asking important questions should be urged in this process. Self-help could be strengthening but may also restrict or negate your recovery. Hiring a legal professional should be contemplated with the same level of thought and consideration as that given to the selection of a medical professional, accountant, financial advisor or therapist.
4. QUESTION: How do I know if I need a lawyer?
ANSWER: If you have recently been served with a Summons and comparable documents (Complaint, Petition, Motion), you should endeavor to seek legal guidance now. Papers filed in court that start a lawsuit call for responses that involve specific deadlines; missing out on those deadlines could compromise your defense, reduce or avoid your recovery. Some matters by statute involve a "pre-suit" time period that allow you to take into account the legal issues and potential resolution before a suit is filed. Similarly, seeking legal counsel at the earliest opportunity is recommended.
5. QUESTION: Precisely what is mediation?
ANSWER: Mediation is a course of action whereby the parties to the case present at an agreed location with their counsel (if retained) and a decided on mediator to try and resolve all or some of the issues involved. Mediators should be unrelated to all parties and the litigation at issue, are to stay impartial in between the parties and their counsel, and continue maintaining the confidential nature of the conference to encourage settlement and resolution. Typically the parties share the cost of the mediation equally but other arrangements might be made if all parties are in agreement in advance of the conference. Mediation is normally required in just about every case filed in court and before a trial is held.
6. QUESTION: What type of attorney do I need?
ANSWER: Again, like other sectors, attorneys may specialize in a certain or more than one area. Similarly, law offices may specialize, offer general legal needs or provide services in a few unique areas of law. Trial lawyers deal with cases involving lawsuits; family law lawyers handle divorce cases, child custody/visitation, child support, alimony and related matters; general practitioners handle nearly all matters. Some areas of law are very technical, like bankruptcy or taxation; some are delineated by statute, such as worker's compensation. Any lawyer should be able to talk about your specific issue, determine if he or she is prepared to take care of such matters or advise you of the necessity to seek advice from another in a specialised area.
