Aston Villa boss Steve Bruce faces the press today ahead of the trip to Ipswich on Saturday.
Bruce and Villa are in good form at the moment; they've secured wins in each of their first three matches of the season in all competitions and head to Portman Road looking to make it three consecutive league wins at the start of a campaign for the first time since 1962.
Manager Bruce, speaking to Aston Villa's official Facebook page at the club's Bodymoor Heath training ground this morning, will provide updates on his squad fitness wise, the transfer front with the loan window still open for another couple of weeks and all else claret and blue related.

Ipswich Town manager Paul Hurst is fully aware of how buoyed Aston Villa are as the claret and blues make their way to Portman Road on Saturday.
Villa have won their first three matches of the season, toppling Hull, Wigan and Yeovil, and head to Suffolk with a positive mind-set - both on and off the field.
Steve Bruce spoke recently of how desperate Villa's financial situation was just weeks ago prior to the arrival of new majority owners Nassef Sawiris and Wes Edens.
Key players were expected to depart in order for the club to continue paying the wages of its staff.
Now, though, things couldn't be more different.

Hurst, who impressively led Shrewsbury Town to the finals of the Checkatrade Trophy and the League One play-offs last season before replacing Mick McCarthy at the Tractor Boys, expects a real test.
"It presents a very big challenge. The new investors have given the club a boost," Hurst said at his pre-match press conference.
"They've came out and said Steve Bruce is the man - in my opinion rightly so, that shouldn't even be up for discussion.
"It's maybe bad news for the rest of us; the new investors are going to allow them to bring in to what is already a good squad anyway.
"Let's not kid ourselves; if they can add more quality to that, with the crowd that they get, they'll be one of the contenders."
Despite that, Hurst has challenged his own group to shake off the defeats to Rotherham and Exeter in the past week and give Villa themselves plenty to think about.

He has also urged them not to be intimidated.
"For each game you go into, there are only three points at stake - no more, no less, whether it's Aston Villa or Rotherham," Hurst continued.
"At the same time, you want to be involved in the games where you know there's going to be a really good atmosphere.
"Away fans will be there in their numbers, I'm sure our fans will respond in turn.
"You want to play against the best teams; there's no better feeling than when you can come out the right side of a result against a team that will be going into it as favourites.
"These are the ones you look forward to. Naturally there will be a little bit of apprehension, but I'm interested to see how the players do approach it." Read Mor
