Podcast: 'Celtic are in a bit of a rut'<br />Rodgers' side have now won two of their past seven games - conceding in six of those - but will still be favourites to win next Thursday's second leg in Glasgow and reach the Europa League group stage.<br />The manager, though, was downbeat in his assessment of a performance that highlighted their need for defensive reinforcements, with continued uncertainty over Dedryck Boyata's future and a new injury concern around Jozo Simunovic, who was forced off with an ankle knock.<br />"When you work with what you have, you have to try to improve it and make it better," Rodgers said.<br />"Games like that, especially away from home, you have to demonstrate that hunger to not concede, and it was too easy.<br />"It was a terrific ball into the box but we have to defend it better than that. It gave them a bit of oxygen in the game that our start should never have given them."<br />'I feel for the supporters'<br />Rodgers praised the contribution of 19-year-old winger Mikey Johnston, who created Olivier Ntcham's third-minute opener after a "great bit of skill" in his first European start.<br />But the Celtic manager felt his side "came off plan a bit in terms of running too much, blocking each other's space and we didn't really have the intensity and tempo we wanted".<br />He added: "I feel for the supporters. They have come all the way out here - about 200 of them - and we have to be much better than that.<br />"We are controlling a lot of the games, But against AEK we had four shots on target against us over two games where we were clearly a better team, but we conceded three goals. So it has to stop.<br />"Next week we want to finish off the job but we will need to play with a greater tempo than we did this evening."<br />Rodgers was unsure about the extent of the ankle injury sustained by Simunovic in the second half.<br />"He took a knock and landed awkwardly, so we will have to see how he is," he added.<br />'He's thrown in a grenade' - analysis<br />BBC Scotland's chief sports writer Tom English on Sportsound:<br />That is as down as I've heard Rodgers in a long time. It's interesting that he says he felt for the supporters - I can't remember him speaking like that before.<br />He's a very canny individual. He's got his message out there and it's a bit more pressure applied on the board. He's thrown in this grenade and this is a strategy to bend the club to his will again, as he has to do to protect himself. There is a game within the game going on at Celtic Park.<br />Former Scotland striker Steven Thompson on Sportsound:<br />He's having a pop at his players and his board. It doesn't sound like a man who is particularly enjoying his work at the moment. Maybe the club didn't think they had to strengthen and Rangers caught them on the hop a wee bit. I think it has been complacency.<br /
