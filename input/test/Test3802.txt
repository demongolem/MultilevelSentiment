Spielwarenmesse makes changes to ToyAwards
Additional category introduced, and digital preliminary round added to the judging process.
As it prepares for its 70th anniversary from 30th January to 3rd February 2019, the Spielwarenmesse toy fair in Nuremberg is making improvements to its coveted awards. The team is introducing an additional category for start-ups and adding a digital preliminary round to the judging process.
Entries may be submitted from 15th September . All companies exhibiting at the Spielwarenmesse can enter up to three products in a variety of different categories. Entries are free of charge and should be registered at www.toyaward.com . The four existing, age-specific groups: Baby & Infant (0-3 years), Pre-school (3-6 years), SchoolKids (6-10 years) and Teenager & Adults (from 10 years) will be extended this year to include a Start-up Category, which is open to all companies founded less than five years ago. The closing date for entries is 23rd November.
In recent years, the number of entries for the ToyAwards has reached record levels. In 2017 alone, 397 companies sent in a total of 643 innovations. "To make it easier for exhibitors to take part in the ToyAwards, we have decided to introduce a digital preliminary round," commented Christian Ulrich, director of marketing. All companies are initially required to submit a product description, together with photos and preferably videos, in English, to the ToyAwards website. The jury of experts will shortlist the best innovations in the digital preliminary round. The shortlisted products will then be sent to Spielwarenmesse eG. In the run-up to the show, the expert jury will come together to select three products in each category. During the final judging phase, the criteria from the digital preliminary round will be extended.
The final 15 nominees for the ToyAwards will be revealed at the main press conference marking the 70th Spielwarenmesse on 24th January 2019. Awards will be presented to the winners at the Opening Ceremony on 29th January. More information on entering the ToyAwards can be found at www.toyaward.com .
