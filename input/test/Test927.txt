RISING SUN â€” Once again Commissioner David Warnick is poring over old records and maps to figure out the ongoing situations in Valley View Village, a townhouse community off East Main Street.
Residents of the community have been bringing their concerns to the board for years; listing among them lack of police presence, parking, trash and debris. New to the discussion Tuesday night was Alisha Rausch, bringing her concerns to the board about one particular residence.
"The grass was waist high, the resident left and there was a foul smell," Rausch said, adding she could see hundreds of cat food cans inside and that the ceiling had collapsed.
"The police officer never looked, never set foot on the property. He talked to a neighbor," Rausch said. "If there's a possibility of abandoned animals why is this not a concern?"
Rising Sun Police Chief Francis "Chip" Peterson told Rausch his department is well aware of that particular residence and assured Rausch that he and the town were monitoring. However, he said there was no just cause to enter the home.
"We got a call about a month and a half ago," Peterson said. "We made contact with the owner but then the rumor mill took over."
He told Rausch that his officers were assured that there were no animals or people in the home and that the owner was away for a time caring for a sick relative.
Noting that the homes are connected, Rausch said neighbors needed to know that to make sure adjacent homes would not be damaged if there was a water leak in that house.
That's when Warnick brought up the latest revelation into the more than 40-year-old community.
"We've been looking at covenant deeds," Warnick said. "The original plat shows open space in three locations."
Warnick said his research shows that the open space changed hands several times in 1974, selling one of those plats for $10 to the owners of 59 Louise Court. In the title for that plat are rules including that there would never be any development there, no parking of boats, trailers or abandoned vehicles, and no utilities, fencing, or unsightly signages.
"Here's the problem. We do not have the legal authority to enforce that," Warnick said. The deeds as written give that power to the Valley View Village Home Owners Association. "It should be enforced by the HOA but it was never established."
Warnick said issues among the neighbors will have to go to the civil court system outside of criminal activity or code enforcement issues.
"The HOA would have taken care of a lot of these," Warnick noted, to which Rausch wondered aloud why that HOA was never formed.
Rausch told the board that while the parking lot is considered public, there are some residents who feel entitled to spots directly in front of their homes. She has that problem.
"When you're coming to my door and banging on it that's a problem," she said. A few others park across two spots, which is another issue she reported.
She asked the board whatever happened to plans for an overflow parking lot. Warnick said that's all part of that confusing covenant deed that spells out what can happen on the only open spaces in Valley View.
Peterson said law enforcement can only write tickets.
"We can issue citations but we cannot enforce who parks where," Peterson said.
There was some good news. Calvin Bonenberger, town administrator, told her that plans are about to commence to install 1,000 linear feet of sidewalk and curbing and address 7,000 feet of pavement in need of repair and paving. Rausch welcomed that, saying that the conditions on the lower end are worse than those at the top.
"There are potholes that go all the way down the street and are probably a foot deep," she said. "Part of the road is sinking."
Rausch said it's time that Valley View got the same attention as newer subdivisions in town.
"This really is a nice community," she said. "People think I live in the ghetto of Rising Sun and I don't.
