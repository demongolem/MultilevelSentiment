HIGHLIGHTS
Over 12,800 persons have been verified through the Government of Bangladesh and UNHCR joint verification exercise, as of 15 August. All persons above the age of 12 received an ID card and all households received a family certificate, which will be used for the provision of protection and assistance in Bangladesh. The exercise aims to consolidate a unified database for identity management, documentation, provision of protection and assistance, population statistics, and ultimately solutions.
Shelter upgrades continue in the camps and settlements, with 212,360 households (100% of target) supported with extra tarps, rope, bamboo and wire, and 160,637 householdssupported with tie-down kits (76% of target), to strengthen existing shelters.
As of 12 August 2018, 40,296 refugees have been relocated into newly developed sites, including relocations for landslide and flood risk mitigation, infrastructure development as well as new arrivals; 24,401 of these were due to landslide risks. During the rest of August, 2,730 more refugees are planned to be relocated.
The recent assessment of over 100 health facilities by the Ministry of Health and the sector revealed that medical waste management is a key gap in the camps. Critical health gaps also remain in some specialty areasâ€”including for host communities in the vicinity of the campsâ€”such as surgical services, 24/7 availability of health services, and clinical mental health services. Heavy rains raise risks of water- and vector-borne diseases.
WASH sector, with support from CDC, is reviewing emergency water quality surveillance guidelines to guide immediate and longterm monitoring of water quality using a community engagement approach. Ongoing works for latrines and bathing facilities protection include sand bagging, foundation reinforcement and earthworks.
Inadequate education services for adolescents between 15 to 24 years of age remains a major concern. Less than 2,000 adolescents have access to education or life skills training â€“ out of the 117,000 in need. The Education Sector's Youth Working Group is preparing a white paper to highlight the needs and consequences of underserving the youth.
Safe space for emergency evacuations is urgently needed due to the ongoing risks of high winds and heavy rains. More land is also needed for sustainable relocation sites as severely congested camp conditions have far-reaching negative consequences.
Sizable funding gaps continue to limit humanitarian capacity. For example, the number of Mobile Nutrition Teams available for the monsoon and cyclone preparedness and response has been reduced due to the funding shortfall.
