if I enable two factor. Can we do that?<br />Incentives matter.<br />August 23, 2018<br />The company is giving users a new emote (the victory dance you&#8217;ve seen emulated in airports, playgrounds and parks by kids and tweens around the world) to anyone who turns on two-factor authentication. It&#8217;s one small (dance) step for Epic, but one giant leap for securing their users&#8217; accounts.<br />The thing is any big company could do this (looking at you<br />Microsoft,<br />Apple, Alphabet and any other company with a huge user base).<br />Apparently the perk of not getting hacked isn&#8217;t enough for most users, but if you give anyone the equivalent of a free dance, they&#8217;ll likely flock to turn on the feature.<br />It&#8217;s not that two-factor authentication is a panacea for all security woes, but it does make life harder for hackers. Two-factor authentication works on codes, basically tokens, that are either sent via text or through an over-the-air authenticator (OTA). Text messaging is a pretty crap way to secure things, because the codes can be intercepted, but OTAs &#8212; like Google Authenticator or Authy &#8212; are sent via https (pretty much bulletproof, but requiring an app to use).<br />So using SMS-based two-factor authentication is better than nothing, but it&#8217;s not Fort Knox (however, these days, even Fort Knox probably isn&#8217;t Fort Knox when it comes to security).<br />Still, anything that makes things harder for crimes of opportunity can help ease the security burden for companies large and small, and the consumers and customers that love them (or at least are forced to pay and use them).<br />I&#8217;m not sure what form the perk could or should take. Maybe it&#8217;s the promise of a free e-book or a free download or an opportunity to have a live chat with the celebrity, influencer or athlete of a user&#8217;s choice. Whatever it is, there&#8217;re clearly something that businesses could do to encourage greater adoption.<br />Self-preservation isn&#8217;t cutting it. Maybe an emote will do the trick.<br /
