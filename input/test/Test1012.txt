A teenager from Melbourne, Australia has pleaded guilty to hacking Apple, downloading 90GB of secure files and accessing customer accounts, The Age reported .
The school student appeared in Children's Court this week, where it heard that he started hacking Apple's systems when he was 16.
His lawyer stated that the teen hacked Apple several times over the course of a year because he was a big fan of the company, and that he dreamed of working there.
Australian Federal Police obtained and executed a search warrant for the teen's home last year, the court heard, where they seized two Apple laptops, a mobile phone, and a hard drive.
Hacking files and instructions were discovered in a directory on a computer titled "hacky hack hack."
According to the report, sentencing will proceed next month.
