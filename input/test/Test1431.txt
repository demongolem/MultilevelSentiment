Sessions urges bump stock ban through regulation<br />(CNN)<br />Hours after being repeatedly insulted by President Donald Trump, Attorney General Jeff Sessions just did something he rarely, if ever, does: He punched back -- hard.<br />Here's Sessions' full statement:<br />"I took control of the Department of Justice the day I was sworn in, which is why we have had unprecedented success at effectuating the President's agenda -- one that protects the safety and security and rights of the American people, reduces violent crime, enforces our immigration laws, promotes economic growth, and advances religious liberty.<br />While I am Attorney General, the actions of the Department of Justice will not be improperly influenced by political considerations.
