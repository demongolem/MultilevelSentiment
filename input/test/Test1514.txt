Notes on Non-GAAP Adjustments:<br />(1)<br />The Company recorded pre-tax charges of $3 million and $15 million in the thirteen and twenty-six weeks ended August 4, 2018, respectively, in connection with its U.S. retirement plan litigation and required plan reformation.  A pre-tax charge of $50 million was recorded in the thirteen and twenty-six weeks ended July 29, 2017 related to the same matter. As disclosed in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K, the Company must reform the pension plan and the amount accrued will continue to increase with interest until paid, as mandated by the provisions of the required plan reformation. Accordingly, during the twenty-six weeks ended August 4, 2018, the Company recorded charges totaling $6 million representing this increase. Additionally, the amount accrued was increased during the first quarter of 2018 by $7 million reflecting updated estimates of the cost of reformation.  Finally, we incurred $2 million in administrative costs associated with the reformation during the twenty-six weeks ended August 4, 2018.<br />The Company applied a marginal tax rate on the non-GAAP adjustment.<br />(2)<br />On December 22, 2017, the United States enacted tax reform legislation that included a broad range of business tax provisions. The Company recognized, during the fourth quarter of 2017, a $99 million provisional charge for the mandatory deemed repatriation of foreign sourced net earnings and a corresponding change in our permanent reinvestment assertion under ASC 740-30. During the second quarter of 2018, the Company revised its provisional amount by approximately $1 million. Our accounting for the new legislation is not complete and we have made reasonable estimates for some tax provisions and will continue to make and refine calculations as additional analysis is completed.<br />We exclude the discrete U.S. tax reform effect from our adjusted diluted EPS as it does not reflect our ongoing tax obligations under U.S. tax reform.<br />(3)<br />During the second quarter of 2018, the U.S. Treasury issued a notice that delayed the effective date of regulations under Internal Revenue Code Section 987. These regulations, which were promulgated in December 2016, changed our method for determining the tax effects of foreign currency translation gains and losses for our foreign businesses that are operated as branches and are reported in a currency other than the currency of their parent. As a result of the delay in the effective date, the Company updated its calculations for the effect of these regulations, which resulted in an increase to deferred tax assets and a corresponding reduction in our income tax provision in the amount of $1 million.<br />Foot Locker, Inc.<br /
