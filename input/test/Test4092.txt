Bonus: How to get rid of mosquitoes for good The only sure way to prevent mosquitoes is to make sure you don't lay out the welcome mat for them. That means regularly checking your yard for standing water â€” from pet dishes to bird feeders and other shallow areas where H20 might have accumulated, says Glen Ramsey, an entomologist at Orkin .
"Mosquitoes need water to reproduce, so limiting this will hurt their ability to have population booms," he says.
If nothing's doing the trick, you can always hire a pest control company to spray your yard for mosquitoes. But make sure you do your research and check credentials so you don't do more harm than good. On average, mosquito control services will run you $350 to $500 per season for a quarter- to half-acre property.
