Chris Waller has his group 1 winning three-year-olds from last season â€“ D'argento and Unforgotten â€“ taking on Winx on Saturday, but it might a four-year-old away from the Randwick limelight who has the potential to join the stable's stars at the highest level.
A touch of arrogance: Kaonic streets the opposition on his return to racing last month.

"Their ability gets them only so far but, until they fully mature, they don't get to their top level," Waller said. "We don't have a problem waiting for them to be ready.
"Kaonic has matured into a lovely man instead of being a stressful colt. I think that is because we didn't gas him and throw him in impossible situations."
After two spring wins, Kaonic was held back from a Melbourne preparation last year and then, although unplaced in the Randwick Guineas and Rosehill Guineas, he was not stressed by too much racing as a three-year-old.

"It was disappointing when Paret and Kaonic didn't come up in the autumn, but we have learnt not to panic. We just pulled up stumps and gave them a good long break" Waller said.
"You see the benefit of it now. Paret has gone to another level, and Kaonic is heading in the same direction.
"Saturday is another test for him, but if you let them mature this is what you get. I think he and Paret have bigger things in front of them.
"Paret is probably a little sharper than Kaonic, but they are on the same path toward races like Epsom.
"I don't know if Paret will get a strong mile, and I see Kaonic as more an 1800m to 2000m type in time."
Kaonic has been heavily supported as he steps up 1400m at Randwick and has been $3.80 to $3.20 at Beteasy. Waller is keeping his options open with the four-year-old, but the Epsom is the likely target if he keeps improving as expected.
"He has got a bit of arrogance back after that impressive win first-up and he is in for a good prep," Waller said. "The 1400m is probably a bit short for him second-up, but he is doing every right.
