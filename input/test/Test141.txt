Celtic picked up a second straight win at the start of the campaign when they beat Golden Arrows 2-0 in Durban on August 8, thanks to goals from Tshegofatso Mabaso and Kabelo Dlamini. Phunya Sele Sele's only home game so far this term brought a 2-0 victory over Chippa United on the first weekend of the month, and the chance to test themselves against a Soweto giant will be a great motivator for Steve Komphela and his team. Pirates come into the game on the back of a midweek 1-0 home loss at the hands of Bidvest Wits. The Soweto giants dominated the game, but a late own goal from Gladwin Shitolo cost them their first defeat of the season. The Buccaneers' only away game so far this term brought them a 1-0 win at Chippa United on August 8. On that occasion they benefited from an own goal by Chippa United defender Gerald Modisane. In head-to-head stats, Celtic and Pirates have met in 60 league matches since 1985. The Buccaneers have claimed 31 wins compared to 14 for Phunya Sele Sele, while 15 matches have been drawn. The Bloemfontein side has a record of 10 wins, nine draws and 11 losses from their 30 matches as hosts in the rivalry. Last season Pirates completed a league 'double' over Celtic, winning 1-0 in Bloemfontein and 2-1 in Soweto. Former Phunya Sele Sele star Musa Nyatama scored in both games for the Buccaneers. Celtic's line-up from their 2-0 win over Arrows on August 8: Tignyemb, Sam, Rikhotso, Gordinho, Ndengane, Dlamini, Mashikinya, Phalane, Potsane (Masuku 74'), Mabena (Ndou 63'), Mabaso (Baloyi 72'). Pirates' line-up from their 1-0 loss to Wits on August 15: Mpontshane, Thopola, Jele, Shitolo, Maela, Mlambo, Motshwari, Nyatama, Pule (Lorch 77'), Shonga (Mako 67'), Mulenga (Gabuza 47')
