Duncan Garner: Say no to Viagogo and shut it down now DUNCAN GARNER Last updated 18:22, August 17 2018 THREE
A victim of Viagogo speaks out on The AM Show.
OPINION: If online ticket reseller Viagogo was a retail shop on the main street, we would have fireballed the place by now.
If we hadn't gone to that extreme, then surely we might have picketed the shop, embarrassed it into action, done something that demanded it change its ways or give us our money back.
But you can guarantee it would have faced the wrath of society's seriously shafted.
Viagogo is New Zealand's most complained-about retailer, despite being based in Switzerland. It's the perfect location for these reselling cowboys â€“ the business is able to enjoy the proceeds of a 10-year tax holiday if it qualifies, and it's domiciled in a country that has few rules and laws about online or distance selling.

German tourist Stephanie Heinemann was turned away from an All Black test with an invalid ticket from Viagogo.
I think fireballing is still my favourite option, but only if the people behind the ticketing website are locked inside.
Don't get me wrong here, it's not that I don't like the people behind Viagogo. No, let me be clear, l detest everything these depraved, twisted and selfish frauds do to other hard-working and law-abiding people spending their hard-earned dollar.
If something screams that we as the human race have dropped into the gutter and become selfish, greedy and morally bankrupt narcissists, then they'd call it Viagogo. It is, of course, an international scam or fraud masquerading badly as a ticket reseller.
It is largely faceless and hides behind the shop window known as the internet. Its packages are designed to fool you, and you'll be impressed by their approach initially. But ultimately it's a website based on deceit, as it devours your money in return for a myth. It probably makes more money from the overinflated price of the ticket than the star of the show does from a ticket sold legally.
It won't always be a myth â€“ sometimes the heinously overpriced tickets will get you into the magic, if you're one of the lucky ones. Ad Feedback BEVAN READ/STUFF
Duncan Garner: "These traders in misery don't care for the law, they barely have an ethical bone in their body."
That was me earlier this year. Seven of us wanted tickets to take the kids to Bruno Mars. I was given the job of going online. I googled and up came Viagogo. I was none the wiser and did the transaction. Easy. Really, really easy. Total cost $2350.
I thought, "That's expensive," and it bugged me for ages. Then the tickets showed up. They had someone else's name on them and the face value was just $150 each. I complained to Viagogo and got nothing back.
I was so nervous in the leadup to the concert. I was worried we'd get turned away. And imagine the disappointment from the kids and the rage from the angry dad who foolishly used the site.
In the end, we got in, but many were turned away. I spent the entire night awkwardly dancing in the aisles thinking about the unthinkable. My friends still can't believe the ticket price. 1 NEWS
The website is popular among scalpers who buy multiple tickets to events, and sell them on for an inflated price.
So I say hats off to the lumbering Commerce Commission for taking action against Viagogo under the Fair Trading Act. But what good is that really? Doesn't it highlight just how quick and nimble the baddies are, and how cumbersome the reacting authorities have been?
A number of countries are suing Viagogo; Fifa has taken court action too, but these faceless fools continue to hide behind the internet as security. I mean even Fifa has better standards and principles, I think.
The Italians fined the company, but in the wild west of the worldwide web, ethics is something humans must deal with, and Viagogo exists in a sewer of its own.
These traders in misery don't care for the law, they barely have an ethical bone in their body. How depraved and soulless can you get, selling hopes and dreams to kids but in reality they're stealing their money and laughing in their faces.
Sadly, real money buys fake tickets in a world too slow to act. We police everything in our society these days: noise, cellphones and even going up a ladder in the workplace. Why can't we stop, find and nail Mr Viagogo?
I wish the world's law enforcement agencies could act in unison against these web-based thieves. When Kim Dotcom was wanted, we allowed an FBI-style assault on his rented mansion. Now it's the hour of need for many Kiwis, who has our back?
It's a crime to take money from someone for goods that don't exist. So where are the authorities working together across borders to nail these scumbags?
We have to block or shut them down now. Sign up to collapse them. Failing that, and if they honestly are acting between and within the legal framework of Switzerland, let's lobby the Swiss. Do they even care?
Two final points. Google should stop hosting Viagogo online, and it won't survive if we and others protest by walking away. Stop using them, New Zealand. It's not worth the utter heartbreak and worry.
Now could someone bash their door down, arrest them and parade this conga line of evil so we can see what the scammers look like out of the shadows. - The Dominion Pos
