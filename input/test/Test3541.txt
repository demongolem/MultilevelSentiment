KidTreasures.com Kansas City Children's Cooking Classes
Cooking classes are so much fun for everyone in the family â€“ your son or daughter gets to experiment in the kitchen, and bring their new-found skills back home to test in your own kitchen. Plus, it's a great way to get even the pickiest eaters to try a new food. Have a cooking class to offer? Let us know by contacting us below. Johnson Count
