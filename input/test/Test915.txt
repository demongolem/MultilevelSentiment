KFC, one of the UK's biggest fried chicken chains, will open a new restaurant at The Mall in Maidstone.
The popular fast-food chain is set to open this latest location in early November this year, and will be located on the bus station level of the shopping centre, opposite McDonald's.
A small reconfiguration will also be required to accommodate for the new food outlet. The KFC will open in November 2018
The Mall Maidstone's marketing manager, Suzie Brindle, said: "We are so excited to have KFC open at The Mall.
"It's further proof of our commitment to provide the best shopping and dining experience for our customers. There's no doubt KFC will be a great addition to the mall and popular with our customers." Join the debate..
