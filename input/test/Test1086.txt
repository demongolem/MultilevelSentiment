Oil prices slip amid fears over global economic growth Updated 10 sec ago Follow @arabnews
TOKYO: Oil prices fell on Friday, with US crude heading for a seventh weekly decline amid increasing concerns about slowing global economic growth that could hit demand for petroleum products as inventories build. Brent crude oil futures were down 3 cents at $71.40 a barrel by 00229 GMT. US West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures dropped 1 cent to $65.45 a barrel. Brent is heading for a 2 percent decline this week, a third consecutive weekly drop. WTI is on track for a seventh week of losses, with a fall of more than 3 percent. Data on Wednesday showing a large build in US inventories fostered fears about the outlook for fuel demand, while crude was also pressured by broader selling of industrial commodities and by the Turkish financial crisis. "Investors remain cautious as Wednesday's surprise gain in US stockpiles remained fresh in their minds," ANZ said in a note. China and the United States have implemented several rounds of trade tariffs and threatened further duties on exports worth hundreds of billions of dollars, which could knock global economic growth. At the same time, the crisis gripping the Turkish lira has rattled emerging markets and reverberated across equities, bonds and raw materials. US data on Wednesday showed crude output rose by 100,000 barrels per day to 10.9 million bpd in the week ending Aug. 10. Crude inventories increased by 6.8 million barrels, representing the largest weekly rise since March last year. Asian demand is showing signs of slowdown as trade disputes and a stronger dollar drag the economies of some of the world's largest oil buyers.

SYDNEY/SAN FRANCISCO: Apple said on Friday no customer data was compromised after Australian media reported a teenager had pleaded guilty to hacking into its main computer network, downloading internal files and accessing customer accounts. The boy, 16, from the southern city of Melbourne, broke into the US computer giant's mainframe from his suburban home many times over a year, The Age newspaper reported, citing statements by the teenager's lawyer in court. The teen downloaded 90 gigabytes of secure files and accessed customer accounts without exposing his identity, the paper said. Apple contacted the US Federal Bureau of Investigation when it became aware of the intrusion, The Age said, quoting statements made in court. The FBI then referred the matter to the Australian Federal Police (AFP). The report said an AFP raid on the boy's family home produced two laptops, a mobile phone and a hard drive that matched the intrusion reported by Apple. The sensitive documents were saved in a folder called "hacky hack hack," the report said. It said the boy had boasted about his activities on the mobile messaging service WhatsApp. An Apple spokesman said the company's information security personnel "discovered the unauthorized access, contained it, and reported the incident to law enforcement" without commenting further on the specifics of the case. "We ... want to assure our customers that at no point during this incident was their personal data compromised," the spokesman said. The AFP declined to comment because the matter was before the court. A court spokeswoman also declined to comment other than to say the teenager would be sentenced on Sept. 20. The boy's name could not be made public because he was a juvenile offender
