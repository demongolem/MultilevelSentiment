However, none of this has been proven.<br />More than a dozen people, including businessmen and former government officials, were arrested after the notebooks were handed to authorities by La NaciÃ³n newspaper earlier this year.<br />Ms FernÃ¡ndez is also under investigation in another five cases. She denies all allegations, and says she is the victim of a political witch hunt.<br />Related Topics<br /
