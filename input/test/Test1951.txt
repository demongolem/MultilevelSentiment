THE All Blacks will hold a 10kg advantage in the front row, but surprise Wallabies starter Tom Robertson says his hefty partners will be difficult to contain in the scrum.
Roberston has been chosen to start at loosehead prop after Scott Sio failed to overcome a shoulder injury, and will line up alongside Tatafu Polota-Nau and Sekope Kepu - a trio that has never scrummaged together.
They'll be up against the all-Crusaders front row of Owen Franks (118kg) Codie Taylor (111kg) and Joe Moody (120kg), who've been scrumming together for years at Super Rugby and Test level.

SIO BLOW: Prop succumbs to shoulder injury
"Taf's a big guy, trying to use him and Keps - they're big people," Robertson said.
"We'll be trying to use them. They're a good scrum too, we know we're going to have a battle on our hands, but with guys like that in our front row I'm quite confident in our ability."
Robertson (107kg), Polota-Nau (114kg) and Kepu (118kg) combine for 339kg, but that will greatly increase when 135kg back-up tighthead Taniela Tupou enters the fray.
The All Blacks will be relying on the familiarity of their combination to win favour with referee Jaco Peyper.
"They're the best team in the world so their scrum is always going to be pretty dominant, they'll try to use their scrum as a good platform to their backs," said Robertson, who is starting just his third Test in 22 games for Australia.

August 16th 2018 a day ago /display/newscorpaustralia.com/Web/NewsNetwork/Network News/National/ "But in saying that, we've just tried to focus on our scrum because we've got different combinations, Tatafu coming back, Keps I've scrummaged with a bit, but we haven't scrummaged as a front row.
"So we've been focusing on getting our scrum right."
Wallabies coach Michael Cheika said his new combination will thrive in the heat of battle.
"It's about 'I'm on the field, here's the next thing I've got to do and I'm going to do it to the best of my ability', and if that's scrummaging, when scrumagging comes, I know that those guys will deliver," Cheika said.
"They've trained hard all week around the scrum, they know it's going to be a real big battle, but when take care of all the small details and you're ready for them - like they are - I know they'll be well and truly in that battle.

"Scott's been battling on and off with his shoulder since I think the last couple of rounds of Super Rugby and I think we finally found deep down there what was giving him the problem.
"Once we knew that, we could make a clearer decision about his return.
"He could do certain things and he couldn't do others and it was 50/50 but I prefer to call it relatively early in the week and give him a chance to get ready for next week and give Tom a chance to prepare well for this week's contest."
The All Blacks were also forced into a late front row change on their bench when Ofa Tuungafase was ruled out with a rib injury, replaced by Crusader Tim Perry.
Neither Perry or fellow front row replacement Karl Tu'inukuafe have started a Super Rugby match at tighthead.
The Kiwis will use Tu'inukuafe in that role after he spent time there in their "game of three halves" practice match.
