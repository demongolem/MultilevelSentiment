Biometric exercise: Yobe govt to wipe out ghost workers â€“ Gov. Gaidam August 17, 2018 0
Yobe State Governor Ibrahim Gaidam said the state will not have any ghost worker in its employ at the completion of the ongoing workers biometric re-validation exercise.
The governor, who was first to be biometrically re-validated, stated this at the launching of the exercise at the Government House Damaturu
Gaidam noted that the exercise was introduced to update workers data with finance ministry for the purpose of effective salary, pension and other emoluments administration.
"Even so, my expectation is that after the exercise is concluded, we will not have any ghost workers even in the future. We are going to get a final, pure and clean salary figure", he said.
The governor said the last time a major biometric exercise for government workers was carried out was ten years ago in 2008.
"I want to commend the initiators of this exercise â€“ the commissioner of finance and his able team. I could recall that this exercise was last done in 2008. At the end of the exercise, which was meant to stamp out ghost workers, the salary bill increased rather than decreasedâ€¦
"The second biometric was much better where almost all the ghost workers were flushed out. The salary bill dropped to an acceptable level. As at now, I don't think we have any ghost workers in the Ministry of Finance payroll. 2018-08-1
