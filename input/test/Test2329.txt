Transport Minister Anthony Loke said the total of summons issued up to date was 3.1 million cases, worth RM435 million. "The government has agreed not to collect all outstanding AES summonses up to September 1 , as all of it will be cancelled," he said. Loke said the waiver will be a one-off, and there will be no more such offer in the next five years. Starting September 1 , the Road Transport Department (JPJ) will take over the management and operation of AES system. "We will strictly re-enforce the new system, and legal action will be taken for those to who refuse to pay," he said. As of today, only 18 per cent of the total 3.76 million of summons issued since the system's inception n 2012 have been paid. Those who have paid their summons will not receive any refunds from Putrajaya, he said.

Loke said Putrajaya will not continue its agreement with the two companies.He also revealed that the previous administration has used a sum amount of RM555 million from the Armed Forces Fund Board's (LTAT) fund to pay the two companies, whose assets are only the 47 cameras along the highways. "Every summons issued, RM16 is paid to the two companies and 50 per cent of the sums will be paid to them as well," he said.Loke said the government has decided to repay the amount taken from the LTAT fund â€” RM555 million â€” in phases. "We will further discuss with the Defence and Finance ministries over the payment soon," he said
