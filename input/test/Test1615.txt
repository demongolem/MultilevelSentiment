The world has changed for the better when it comes to security and privacy of data, thanks to the European Union's GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation). Companies, especially those operating in the EU-member states have started revising their terms of service and impose internal changes to comply with the requirements. In return for corporations taking care of their customer data better, it is expected for ransomware to become less effective. User education will cover any possibility of corporate employees from falling for trojan horses that can infect their machine for a ransom or even for mining cryptocurrency for the virus authors.
However, the cybercriminals continue their research and development to develop new ways for unsuspecting users to fall for their traps, their new interest is to use GDPR as an extortion racket. GDPR took full effect last May 25, 2018, with a heavy penalty of â‚¬20 million or 4% of their global revenue, whichever is higher.
Unfortunately, not all companies are ready for GDPR with just 20% compliance. With the survey result, 80% is ripe for being targeted. The new possibility of cybercriminals will test penetrate a target corporate network installation, then blackmail the company to pay an extortion, non-compliance means the hack will proceed.
COO of Exonar, Julie Evans has expressed her opinion of GDPR fines as an object of extortion is a reality on the ground: " The perpetrator could threaten to expose the GDPR failure to thousands or even millions of consumers, even handling the Data Subject Access Requests (SARs) alone could be crippling for a company, especially if they are still doing that manually, let alone the cost of compensation that could come from such a class action â€“ it would not be capped at 4% ."
It is strongly recommended that companies invest with a reliable and efficient backup system, in order to restore their systems in the event of any IT threats. Just like the ransomware issue, it will also be a good investment for any company to hire ethical hackers that will perform a thorough penetration testing against their corporate networks.
