Survey reveals high demand for service agreements but only a few workshops offer them
Two major surveys involving 1,176 Danish car owners and 202 Danish workshops reveal a big gap between the supply and demand for service agreements. According to Group CEO Claus T. Hansen, the surveys show a huge market potential for the OMNICAR SAM solution.
Although a service agreement with permanent service calls is attractive to many Danish car owners, only one in three workshops offer service agreements to their customers. This is the main conclusion of two comprehensive surveys carried out by the independent research institute AnalyseDanmark on behalf of OmniCar.
The survey reveals that only 10% of the respondents have a service agreement. However, up to 56% of car owners between 18 and 49 years old would be "highly interested" or "to some extent interested" in having a service agreement with their preferred workshop. Only 11% of the car owners surveyed were offered a permanent service agreement when they last visited a workshop.
Group CEO at OmniCar, Claus T. Hansen, says that workshops are missing out on a great opportunity to attract and gain loyal customers: " survey results show a clear gap between the car owners' interest in a service agreement and the workshops' ability to meet this demand. Workshops are missing out on a huge extra sales potential, but what is more essential â€“ they are not benefiting from the single greatest opportunity available: to make customers come back again and again through a service agreement with permanent service calls."
Research institute AnalyseDanmark has interviewed representatives from 202 workshops about their use of service agreements and their range of services in general. The survey shows that a total of 30% of the workshops use service agreements. Only 10% of the workshops with only one person employed make use of service agreements whereas 75% of the workshops with more than 10 employees offer service agreements. However, only 11% have a software solution that can manage service agreements.
Among the workshops who offer a service agreement, one in four car owners have a service agreement. Half of the workshops with service agreements also offer service agreements for used cars.
The surveys were carried out in May and June 2018.
