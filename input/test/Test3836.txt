Lucifer
For anyone out there who was worried that Lucifer season 4 may wait to give you much in the way of Amenadiel, don't be.
In a new video on Twitter (see below), DB Woodside teased the return of his character in super-dramatic (and awesome) fashion. At the end of season 3, Amenadiel took Charlotte Richards off into the sky, hopefully so that she can have some sort of peace within her afterlife. We weren't quite sure how long it was going to be before we got to see him, but ultimately, this is proof the show isn't wasting any time.
As for where Amenadiel is, that's an entirely different question. The fire outside certainly suggests that this could be a hellish environment and that is one way to look at this. It may look like the penthouse at first glance, but we know that this is the show that has a great capacity to trick us, to make us think that we're seeing one thing when, in reality, we're looking at something totally different altogether.
The fourth season officially started filming earlier this week and over the premiere, we imagine that we're going to get a chance to see how Chloe is coping after learning the truth about Lucifer's devil face. Beyond that, we imagine that mourning Charlotte will be an important story point for Dan and others. Oh, and of course we're pretty confident that there's going to be some sort of case because it wouldn't be Lucifer without one. These are people who have to learn how to compartmentalize.
You'll get a chance to see Woodside and many of your other characters coming up when Lucifer season 4 premieres on Netflix presumably at some point in 2019. We imagine that there will be many more teasers along the way.
