Underground mines are unforgiving and unpredictable workplaces that, through accidents or acts of nature, can and still do claim lives of the miners who work in them.
However thanks to the ingenuity of two WA blokes 20 years ago more than 40,000 miners across the globe have a better chance at returning home to their families in the event of a toxic gas outburst, rock fall or fire.
Geoff Whittaker and Gerald Ness started their mine refuge chamber manufacturing business Minearc Systems in 1999 after seeing glaring deficiencies in the 'safe havens' miners were expected to run to in an emergency.

The company, which won Telstra's WA business of the year award on Thursday night, revolutionised underground mine safety with its sealed refuge chambers that scrubbed the build-up of harmful CO2 and CO from the air.

Minearc marketing manager Lesley Emery said the design extended the survivability of the miners who used it from hours to days.
"Before they came along refuge chambers were essentially just a shipping container and they had no redundancies. It would get very hot, it was a very risky environment for people to stay in for a long period of time," he said.
"They flipped that on its head."
Ms Emery said were currently 2500 refuge chambers in use across 52 countries.
WA mines were the first to get Minearc's refuge chambers, and there are some WA miners who probably wouldn't be here without one.
In 2005 a truck fire in the St Ives gold mine in the Goldfields filled it with toxic plumes of smoke, forcing nine miners to seek refuge in one of Minearc's chambers.
They stayed there for four hours before they were rescued.
In 2009 BHP miner Jason Rose spent 16 hours in a refuge chamber after a rock fall at the Leinster nickel mine.
Minearc's global growth has been meteoric and they have branched out into other sectors like petrochemicals, but there's still plenty of work to do.

"We make sure that everything in a refuge chamber is there to protect lives and save lives rather than making a buck," she said.
Telstra executive director of marketing Jeremy Nicholas congratulated Minearc and said they had invested technology and research and development into local communities, setting the standard for the mining industry worldwide while saving lives.
