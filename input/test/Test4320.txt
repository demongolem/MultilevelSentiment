The Tatton Group has launched "Tatton Tech", aimed at resolving issues with broadband in local rural areas.
Fed up of hearing other rural businesses express their frustration at poor rural broadband connectivity, Tatton Tech founder Henry Brooks has called on the Government to bring forward their plans to bring universal high-speed broadband to stop the untold damage being done to the UK's rural communities. The latest of numerous warnings comes in the Local Government Association's Post-Brexit England Commission interim report, issued last month, which stated that lack of access to reliable broadband and mobile networks threatens rural livelihoods after Brexit. The report said rural communities across England are facing a "perfect storm" of threats to their future, fuelled by unfit-for-purpose network infrastructure, increasing property prices and an ageing population, which may be made much worse after Brexit . Mr Brooks, who is also on the policy committee of the Country Land and Business Association and President of the Cheshire Agricultural Society said: "Rural business owners cite a persistent litany of problems especially poor broadband coverage, but the universal high-speed broadband promised by the Government is not due to arrive before 2020, after Brexit, which is too late even if on time. We have experienced this ourselves and became so fed up we decided to find our own solution for customers all over the country." Tatton Tech is rolling out the latest radio broadband technology to offer businesses and nearby residents â€“ especially in hard to reach areas â€“ first class digital connectivity with three core products: Tatton Ultrafast for businesses; Tatton Superfast for home office; and Tatton Fast for home use. He said: "For our business and thousands of others across the UK from farmers and home workers to large corporates, digital connectivity is now critical. We have also heard from many people in our area who struggle for rural broadband despite being close to Manchester and as a result are suffering increasing crime, so wireless CCTV is also becoming more and more important which relies on a good internet connection. "Much has been said about rebalancing the UK economy, especially critical as we approach life outside the European Union when we need to be filling skills and productivity gaps and quite frankly quickly rolling out high speed broadband to rural areas is like picking low-hanging fruit â€“ it's easy! In the meantime, we are not prepared to sit around and be left behind and that's why we are taking the matter into our hands. "The UK is blessed not just with rural economies but economies in rural areas and they rightly and fairly need to be properly served. Cheshire and Warrington's output per head, for example, according to the Office for National Statistics is more than 20% higher than the UK average and is the second highest of any sub-region outside of London despite terrible connectivity. People's livelihoods and the UK's economy is badly damaging as a result." Historically, rural landowners and their tenants have been put off by the cost of leased lines. Tatton Group was quoted more than Â£25,000 for one connection and then in excess of Â£1,000/month, hence seeking a better solution and by doing it themselves it came in at a much reduced price. The first connection was made at the group's Tatton Studio, a Film and Television facility at rural Ashley Hall in Cheshire regularly used by the BBC and others, including ITV, Fox, Netflix and Channel 4. Those who use the studios are now able to transfer up to 400 gigabytes of material a day. Edmond Kelleher, Tatton Tech director, said: "We have found that the service we have been trialling is better value for money than leased lines especially when there is no digging of holes and no hidden costs. Once installed, as we have seen ourselves, it enables all sorts of other technology saving costs (e.g. VOIP telephones) and increasing productivity, meaning you don't have to work in the city to get on
