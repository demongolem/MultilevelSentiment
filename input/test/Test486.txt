Ankush Nikam 0 Comments Increase in the demand for fuel efficient vehicle coupled with increasing stringent emissions norms are driving the demand for hybrid vehicles. In mild hybrid vehicles, energy is produced while applying brake pedal and it turns into electric energy that is then stored in a battery, this stored energy is used to turn on the starter motor for start-stop function.At present mild hybrid vehicle are preferred over battery electric vehicles and hybrid vehicles, as the cost involved with them is quite high as compared with mild hybrid vehicles.
Mild-hybrids make use of regenerative braking and start stop technology, but they tend not to return as high an EPA rated mpg as electric vehicles or full hybrids. In many countries such as U.S., Germany, and UK, government provides subsidies and incentives to support the purchase of the electric vehicle. For instance, in U.S., government provide tax credit $2,500 to $7,500 per new electric vehicle purchased. Similarly, in Germany, government provides a subsidy of $4,000 on a purchase of new electric vehicle. The government also launched US$ 1,069.2 Mn electric vehicle incentive program launched in Germany for electric vehicle customers.
Stringent government emission norms, increasing awareness regarding hybrid vehicles, and environmental concerns will spur the demand for mild hybrid vehicles market . Along with this, mild hybrid vehicles provide better fuel economy than the conventional vehicles which acts as attractive parameter for the end users to purchase the vehicle as the rise in the prices of petroleum products increases the operation costs of the vehicles. The concerns for rising pollution is also driving the market for hybrid vehicles including mild hybrids specifically in developed countries. There are some countries where governments have removed subsidy on mild hybrid vehicles which will hamper the growth of mild hybrid vehicle. For instance in India, government withdraw the subsidy on mild hybrid diesel cars under FAME (Faster Adoption and Manufacturing of Hybrid and Electric Vehicles) scheme. This decision is tends to affect the market for mild hybrid vehicles in India.
