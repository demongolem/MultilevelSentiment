Denmark â€“ Bethard granted license to operate in Denmark
Bethard Casino continues to extend its geographic reach across Europe. The company today announced that it has been granted a license to operate in Denmark.
"We are very satisfied to get a green light in Denmark and we look forward to start growing our presence in the Danish market," said Erik Skarp, co-founder and CEO of Bethard Group. "2018 is a truly exciting year for us, one in which we are determined to lay a solid foundation for establishing Bethard as Europe's leading sports betting brand. And we have had a great start. First with the announcement of Zlatan Ibrahimovic joining our team, followed by a very successful start in the U.K. market and a great World Cup. Now the time has come to conquer Denmark."
Bethard Casino is currently licensed in Malta, Denmark and the U.K. Applications for a gambling license has been filed in Sweden. Work on a license application for a state license in Schleswig-Holstein in Germany has been initiated. The company is actively seeking licenses in several other markets and expects to have a licensed presence in most key European markets already by 2020.
Bethard Casino will start welcoming Danish players to the site within weeks.
