Chapter 05<br />South China Sea standoff<br />Chinaâ€™s rapid expansion in the South China Sea is the realization of a dream by the countryâ€™s leader, Xi Jinping.<br />In April, standing on the deck of the Chinese destroyer Changsha in the South China Sea, Xi reviewed one of the largest displays of Chinese military might in the countryâ€™s history. It was a stunning display of naval power by a nation that has invested vast sums of money to modernize its outdated fleet.<br />Its shipbuilding capacity is accelerating rapidly -- the Chinese navy launched its second aircraft carrier in April 2017, while a third one is rumored to be under construction.  On a single day in July 2018, China launched two new, highly sophisticated destroyers to join its impressive fleet. The expansion of the country's fleet and rapid militarization of artificial islands sends a clear message to China's rivals in the region -- the South China Sea is now firmly under its control.<br />Chinese aircraft carrier fleet operates during training in the South China Sea in December, 2016.<br />- Credit: Photo by VCG via Getty<br />The United States says Beijing has broken a promise made to former US President Barack Obama in 2015 not to militarize its artificial islands. Washington is leading a coalition of other nations to regularly conduct freedom of navigation operations in the sea to demonstrate the right of passage through international waters. China says the American presence demonstrates why it needs to deploy more troops and military hardware to the South China Sea. It says it needs to prepare to defend itself in the region.<br />"The US military presence by the South China Sea far exceeds the total military strength of China and other littoral countries," Chinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying said in May. "Does the US truly want the freedom of navigation entitled under the international law? Or does it just want the freedom to do whatever it likes as a hegemon?"<br />Chinese President Xi Jinping speaks after reviewing the Chinese Navy fleet in the South China Sea<br />- Credit: Li Gang/Xinhua via AP, File<br />A US Navy P-8A Poseidon sits on the tarmac at Kadena Air Base on the Japanese island of Okinawa<br />- Credit: Brad Lendon, CNN<br />US Navy warships make frequent patrols in the South China Sea<br />- Credit: US Navy<br />One of the first maps outlining China&#x27;s territorial claims in the South China Sea, then an eleven-dash line, in 1947<br />- Credit: 1947 Nanhai Zhudao - Wikimedia Commons<br />Chinese J-15 fighter jets on the deck of the Liaoning aircraft carrier during military drills in the Yellow Sea, off China&#x27;s east coast<br />- Credit: STR/AFP/Getty Images<br />President Xi Jinping onboard Navy destroyer Haikou during an inspection<br />- Credit: Xinhua/Wang Jianmin via Newscom<br />Chapter 06<br />No backing down<br />The standoff between Washington and Beijing in the South China Sea has regional powers on edge.<br />They fear a misculation could lead to accidental war. However, neither the US nor China is likely to back down.<br />According to Chinaâ€™s state media, President Xi Jinping told US Secretary of Defense James Mattis in June that â€œany inch of territory passed down from ancestors cannot be lost.â€�<br />US commanders say theyâ€™ve kept these waters open for five decades, and they wonâ€™t stop now.<br />These US Navy flights will continue, challenging Beijingâ€™s expansion, with no end in sight.<br />Related links<br /
