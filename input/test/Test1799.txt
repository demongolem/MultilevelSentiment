This forward-looking financial measure is not presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (&quot;GAAP&quot;) and is a numerical measure of financial performance that excludes or includes amounts so as to be different than the most directly comparable measure that would be presented in accordance with GAAP. Non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the most directly comparable GAAP measures. This forward-looking non-GAAP financial measure is intended to provide additional information to investors regarding Bruker's current expectations surrounding the proposed Hain Lifescience GmbH acquisition. Non-GAAP EPS excludes certain acquisition and integration-related expenses, purchase accounting measurement period adjustments and amortization of acquired intangible assets. Bruker does not provide GAAP financial measures or corresponding reconciliations to such GAAP financial measures on a forward-looking basis because we are unable to predict with reasonable certainty and without unreasonable effort items such as the timing and amount of future acquisition and integration-related charges, purchase accounting measurement period adjustments and amortization of the acquired intangible assets. The timing and amount of these reconciling items are uncertain, depend on various factors outside our management's control and could significantly impact, either individually or in the aggregate, our future EPS calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP.<br />Forward Looking Statements for Bruker Corporation<br />Any statements contained in this press release related to Bruker, Hain Lifescience GmbH and the acquisition of Hain Lifescience GmbH by Bruker which do not describe historical facts may constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.
