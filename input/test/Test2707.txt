Part of IGEL's family of Universal Desktopâ„¢ software-defined thin clients, the IGEL UD7 is designed for end-user computing (EUC) environments where high-performance and access to multiple, high-resolution displays is required. This includes video production and CAD design suites, newsrooms, operations centres and hospital diagnostics centres.
"We are pleased to be teaming with AMD to further enhance the UD7, and to provide our customers with the option of selecting the latest AMD Embedded Radeon processor to power their high-performance, multimedia computing environments," said Matthias Haas, CTO, IGEL. "As the most powerful thin client solution in our portfolio, the IGEL UD7 is a virtualisation-optimised endpoint that is simple to manage, while providing end-users across industries from healthcare to financial services to manufacturing â€“ with highly-secure access to their digital workspaces."
Stephen Turnbull, director of Product Marketing, Datacenter and Embedded Solutions Business Group, AMD added, "AMD has a strong relationship with IGEL, and over the years we've helped them drive a significant amount of innovation for their thin client products. The launch of the IGEL UD7 this year set a new level for high-performance, multi-monitor end-user computing. Now with the addition of an optional AMD Embedded Radeon discrete GPU, UD7 customers can improve the already existing high-quality, multi-monitor thin client computing with even more high-resolution graphics."
Ease of Management, Security and Flexibility for High-Performance Workspaces The IGEL UD7 is managed through the IGEL Universal Management Suiteâ„¢ (UMS), which provides IT organisations with automated backend control of their IGEL endpoints, freeing them up to focus on more strategic initiatives. Purpose-built to simplify complex enterprise environments, the IGEL UMS supports a diverse array of devices and operating systems and enables IT organisations to add and remove endpoint devices and perform software upgrades as needed or required.
Further, through the IGEL OS, IT organisations can future-proof their investments in the UD7 through regular software upgrades to the IGEL OS that include hardware acceleration, while at the same time enhancing the security of their endpoints by preventing malware and other cyber threats with Secure Boot validation.
The IGEL UD7 also comes pre-configured to support industry-leading virtualisation protocols including Citrix HDX, Microsoft RDP/Remote FX or VMware Horizon Blast Extreme. Organisations can add or re-configure these supported virtualisation protocols leveraging the IGEL UMS to quickly transition between protocols and make changes to their entire network of thin clients, or a specific endpoint.
