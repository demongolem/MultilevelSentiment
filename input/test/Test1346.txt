Neck and neck<br />Brett Hundley and DeShone Kizer continue their heated battle to be the Packers' No. 2 quarterback. And with starter Aaron Rodgers expected to sit this one out, both Kizer and Hundley should get plenty of chances to gain some separation.<br />Packers first-year general manager Brian Gutekunst traded for Kizer in March. And through two preseason games, Kizer has a 108.1 passer rating, has thrown two touchdowns and no interceptions.<br />Hundley struggled last year when he was forced into action for an injured Rodgers. But Hundley has played faster and with more consistency this summer, completing 65.2% of his throws with an 86.3 passer rating.<br />Oakland is expected to play its starters for most of the first half. So Kizer and Hundley should get a chance to face a No. 1 defense.<br />â€œItâ€™s really tight,â€� Packers offensive coordinator Joe Philbin said of the No. 2 quarterback battle. â€œYou guys have watched these guys go into games and have production, make good decisions, lead the team on scoring drives whether itâ€™s field goals or touchdowns.<br />â€œTheyâ€™ve all shown some really, really good things. So itâ€™s tight, which is good â€“ itâ€™s a really good problem to have. Itâ€™s not like itâ€™s been a huge separation and the good problem is itâ€™s because theyâ€™ve performed well. Itâ€™s not like they havenâ€™t done well. These next couple games are going to be huge for those guys.<br />2. Tackle issues<br />David Bakhtiari and Bryan Bulaga â€” Green Bayâ€™s starting tackles â€” form one of the better duos in football. The Packers have all sorts of issues behind that pair, though.<br />Jason Spriggs, a second round draft choice in 2016, has been dreadful his first two years in the league. Spriggs has also struggled with consistency this summer.<br />Kyle Murphy, a sixth round draft choice in 2016, has played both left and right tackle. Murphy has improved his strength since coming to Green Bay, but&nbsp;he's also been up and down this summer.<br />Byron Bell, a free agent acquisition on May 30, has been a disappointment and&nbsp;will have to rally to make the roster.<br />â€œI think the hardest thing at whatever level of football â€” high school, college, pro â€” the hardest guys to find are the big guys that can move,â€� Packers general manager Brian Gutekunst said. â€œIâ€™ve always thought itâ€™s really difficult quite frankly after you get out of the spring time to find the bigger guys. Itâ€™s much more difficult.<br />"I kinda feel you can find some legs, guys who can run, but finding big people that can play the game is always one of the most difficult challenges. At the same time if you do your work and youâ€™re prepared, thereâ€™s always guys out there that can help you.â€�<br />3. Familiar face<br />Jordy Nelson caught 550 passes for 7,848 yards&nbsp;and&nbsp;69 touchdowns during his 10-year career in Green Bay. The Packers cut Nelson in March, though, and he signed with the Raiders shortly thereafter.<br />Nelson has played just five snaps this exhibition season and has one catch for four yards. But the Raidersâ€™ No. 1 offense is expected to play well into the second quarter, giving Nelson plenty of chances to line up against his former teammates.<br />â€œEmotionally, it wonâ€™t be a problem,â€� Nelson told reporters earlier this week. â€œItâ€™ll be fun to see those guys, not only the players but the trainers, equipment staff, weight staff, all those guys I was with for 10 years.<br />â€œThose are the guys you miss that you see day-to-day, that you donâ€™t get to talk to as much as youâ€™re used to. Itâ€™ll be fun to see them. Itâ€™s kind of enjoyable as a preseason game so we can have some fun and get in and get out.â€�<br />4. Bubble boys<br />The Packersâ€™ 53-man roster is far from set.<br />There are still stiff competitions at wide receiver, offensive line, outside linebacker and in the secondary â€” just to name a few.<br />Considering teams rarely play their starters for more than a series or two in the final exhibition game, this could be the best chance for several players to prove themselves.<br />â€œWeâ€™re obviously talking pretty regularly throughout, but we try to let the process take place,â€� Gutekunst said of picking the 53-man roster. â€œObviously, the fourth preseason game means a lot to us as far as competition and what guys do in that game. But, yeah, I think as guys get closer to (Week 4), those conversations will pick up and start to get dialed in.â€�<br />5. Wanted: Improvement<br />Green Bayâ€™s No. 1 defense struggled to stop the run against Pittsburgh last week.<br />On&nbsp;the Steelers' third series, No. 2 running back James Conner ripped off three runs for 58 yards, including a 26-yard touchdown burst.<br />On one play, Green Bay had just 10 defensive players on the field.<br />The Packers, under first-year defensive coordinator Mike Pettine, must make immense strides before their season-opener against Chicago on Sept. 9.<br />â€œWas it the scheme? Was it the technique being playing? Or was it the personnel?,â€� Pettine said. â€œEvery run had a reason for it, and there wasnâ€™t anything consistent. We missed two tackles from the safety position, which we have to get cleaned up. Those guys know that. Theyâ€™ll be the first ones to tell you that.<br />â€œBut the run stuff, weâ€™re teaching our guys, especially the guys that werenâ€™t part of the system, some different techniques with how we play certain blocks. The preseason is a learning experience. Weâ€™re not hitting the panic button about the run defense.â€�<br />I have covered the Green Bay Packers for several media outlets since 2001, including the Milwaukee Journal Sentinelâ€™s â€œPacker Plusâ€� and currently Bobmcginnfootball.com.
