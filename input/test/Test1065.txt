NEW YORK, Aug. 17, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Motif Bio plc (AIM/NASDAQ: MTFB), a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company specialising in developing novel antibiotics, today announced that iclaprim data will be presented at the upcoming European Society of Clinical Microbiology and Infectious Diseases (ESCMID)/American Society For Microbiology (ASM) Conference on Drug Development to Meet the Challenge of Antimicrobial Resistance to be held in Lisbon, Portugal, September 4-7, 2018.
This conference focuses on the development of new antimicrobial agents for antimicrobial resistance. It is a multidisciplinary meeting that involves basic scientists, clinical academics, regulatory bodies, funding bodies and the pharmaceutical industry. Its scope stretches from chemistry to clinical development, from neonates to adults, from bacteria to fungi â€“ all with a global perspective.
David Huang, MD, Chief Medical Officer of Motif Bio, will give a presentation on iclaprim as part of the State of the Art Lecture: New Antibacterial Agents on September 5 th , 10:10 AM CET.
In addition, four posters on iclaprim will be presented at the conference. These will be on display throughout the event, September 4-7.

About Iclaprim
Iclaprim is a novel investigational antibiotic with a targeted Gram-positive spectrum of activity. In contrast to commonly used broad-spectrum antibiotics, this "precision medicine approach" is consistent with antibiotic stewardship principles which, among other things, seek to reduce the inappropriate use of broad-spectrum products to avoid the build-up of resistance and to lessen the impact on the microbiome of the patient.
Iclaprim has a different and underutilised mechanism of action compared to most other antibiotics. Following positive results from two Phase 3 trials (REVIVE-1 and REVIVE-2), a New Drug Application (NDA) was submitted to the U.S. Food & Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of acute bacterial skin and skin structure infections (ABSSSI) and is now under review, with a PDUFA date of February 13, 2019. To date, iclaprim has been studied in over 1,400 patients and healthy volunteers. Clinical and microbiological data indicate that iclaprim has a targeted Gram-positive spectrum of activity, low propensity for resistance development and favourable tolerability profile. In clinical studies, iclaprim has been administered intravenously at a fixed dose with no dosage adjustment required in patients with renal impairment or in obese patients. The iclaprim fixed dose may, if approved, help reduce the resources required in hospitals since dosage adjustment by health care professionals is avoided and overall hospital treatment costs may be lower, especially in patients with renal impairment. Many standard of care Gram-positive antibiotics are not suitable for hospitalised ABSSSI patients with renal impairment due to efficacy and/or safety issues.
About Motif Bio
Motif Bio plc (AIM/NASDAQ: MTFB) is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on developing novel antibiotics for hospitalised patients and designed to be effective against serious and life-threatening infections caused by multi-drug resistant Gram-positive bacteria, including MRSA. The Company's lead product candidate is iclaprim. Following positive results from two Phase 3 trials (REVIVE-1 and REVIVE-2), a New Drug Application (NDA) was submitted to the U.S. Food & Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of acute bacterial skin and skin structure infections (ABSSSI) and is now under review, with a PDUFA date of February 13, 2019. More than 3.6 million patients with ABSSSI are hospitalised annually in the U.S. It is estimated that up to 26% of hospitalized ABSSSI patients have renal impairment.
The Company also plans to develop iclaprim for hospital acquired bacterial pneumonia (HABP), including ventilator associated bacterial pneumonia (VABP), as there is a high unmet need for new therapies in this indication. A Phase 2 trial in patients with HABP has been successfully completed and a Phase 3 trial is being planned. Additionally, iclaprim has been granted orphan drug designation by the FDA for the treatment of Staphylococcus aureus lung infections in patients with cystic fibrosis and is in preclinical development for this indication.
Iclaprim has received Qualified Infectious Disease Product (QIDP) designation from the FDA together with Fast Track status. If approved as a New Chemical Entity, iclaprim will be eligible for 10 years of market exclusivity in the U.S. from the date of first approval, under the Generating Antibiotic Incentives Now Act (the GAIN Act). In Europe, 10 years of market exclusivity is anticipated.
