August 15, 2018 Managing landfill leachate is increasingly challenging and costly. SCS Engineers has arranged to provide you with the opportunity to meet with leachate and wastewater experts at the SCS Engineers booth 604 during WASTECON's exhibit hours.
The leachate treatment experts will provide you with the opportunity to discuss the issues and challenges at your landfill's leachate handling/treatment facilities. The experts can discuss with you leachate treatment and management options, best practices, and strategies that make sense at your specific facility and under your site-specific conditions. They can help supplement your knowledge of best practices and provide insight into technology or practices that could be the most effective to help lower your operational costs.
Meet the Experts
