1. MAINE ETHICS COMMISSION VOTES TO SEND CAMPAIGN MONEY
The Maine Ethics Commission, which manages the Clean Elections Campaign Finance Program, voted to start sending out additional funding, even though the legislature hasn't taken steps to allow that.
The program provides money for eligible candidates to run their campaigns, and has been supported twice by Maine voters. Since July 1st, none of the money in this year's clean elections fund has been sent out because of a problem in the wording of the budget, and lawmakers have not agreed on a fix. The ethics commission says a court ruling two weeks ago ordered the governor to release clean elections funds that were supposed to be sent out in late June. Yesterday, they argued that the same court ruling allows the commission to be in charge of sending out money to candidates. Three of the four members disagreed, and voted not to wait any longer.

2. MAINE SUPREME COURT UPHOLDS DISTRICT ATTORNEY CANDIDATE'S SUSPENSION
Maine's highest court has ruled against Seth Carey, a Republican who is running for district attorney in Androscoggin, Franklin, and Oxford counties, even though he has had his license to practice law suspended. His license was suspended for two years after a woman accused him of sexual abuse and secured a protection from abuse order against him. In an effort to get his license back, Carey filed a wide-ranging complaint against several parties, including judges and the board of overseers of the Bar.
A lower court dismissed his complaints, and Carey appealed. Yesterday, the Maine Supreme Court denied Carey's appeal.
