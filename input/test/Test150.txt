Company. The decision follows a thorough strategic review by Coca-Cola FEMSA that took into account several variables and concluded that this course of action is in the best interests of their shareholders. We respect this decision and we appreciate the progress made during Coca-Cola FEMSA's five-year tenure in the Philippines. The market is better positioned than ever before for future success, and we are confident about the potential ahead.
Coca-Cola Philippines will be managed as part of our Bottling Investments Group (BIG), which already has extensive operations in Southeast Asia and is focused on building strong foundations for long-term success.

We look forward to continuing our strong ties in the Philippines, where we have been in operation for over 100 years.
