Developer withdraws homes plan after talks with council Menu Developer withdraws Picket Twenty expansion plans after talks with council Sophie Day @AndoverAdSophie Chief Reporter Picket Twenty 0 comments A DEVELOPER has withdrawn plans to build homes in Picket Twenty as part of "positive dialogue" with the council.
Foreman Homes originally submitted an application to build 99 homes which was then scaled back in January to 78, but the company has now decided to remove the proposal.
Earlier this month a notice on Test Valley Borough Council 's (TVBC) planning website revealed the firm's decision.
But the developer has decided not to give up hope on building the housing estate and has proposed to return with another application for fewer houses.
Planning director Steve Carrington said: "We have sought to take a pragmatic approach in our dealings with the council, and trust that, through our continuing to have a positive dialogue with them, the best solution for the site can be found without our resorting to appeal, and we very much hope, therefore, that our revised scheme - that will likely have significantly fewer numbers - will meet with their positive support.
"We are in the business of building houses, the council are in the business of making them the best that they can be, and we hope that, between us, we can deliver these much needed homes for the community, in as timely a fashion as possible."
It is not known when Foreman Homes will return with a further application, but it expected that talks will continue with TVBC.
The proposed site formed part of the Picket Twenty neighbourhood closer to the Andover Down area of the site.
The move has been welcomed by some, including Jim Thompson, an Andover Down Resident's Action Group member.
He said: "If they are coming back with a scheme that will help join the new to the old then I think that will be fine.
"I was worried that Andover Down was getting over run by Persimmon Homes and the high density homes, but I think if they [Foreman Homes] have reduced the density and bring it into Andover Down type homes then it will be fine.
