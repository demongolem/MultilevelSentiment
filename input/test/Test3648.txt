The prestigious PharmaTimes Marketer of the Year competition closes for entries on 1 September. It only takes a few seconds to fill out the online entry form and then you don't need to do anything else until the day of the competition. This year is extra special as the competition is celebrating its 25th anniversary - and we don't want you to miss out.
Designed to assess and reward the competencies and potential of pharma marketers and teams, the PharmaTimes Marketer of the Year competition identifies and benchmarks marketing talent within pharma organisations.
Entrants must demonstrate a dynamic combination of knowledge, creativity and strategic thinking in real-time challenges within a protected environment. It's a unique opportunity for all marketers, from aspiring to experienced, to sharpen their skills and showcase their talents against marketing professionals, industry-wide.
