Cash was used for working capital needs because of the on-going tight supply chain situation.<br />u-blox carries treasury shares in the amount of<br />CHF 24.4 million<br />; shares that will serve the employee stock options program.<br />Strategic highlights and initiatives<br />Designed to deliver sustainable, profitable growth across market cycles, u-blox's strategy is founded on four discrete pillars: ongoing strengthening of our leading market position; continuing technological development and innovation; outstanding operational performance; and strategic partnerships. Despite a challenging environment in some of our core markets during the first half of 2018, u-blox made advances in all three of its key strategic areas.<br />For instance, strengthening its market and technology leadership, u-blox has partnered with the Kudelski Group, the leader in digital security, to bring premium security to IoT devices. As the IoT takes hold across u-blox's key markets, the importance of dependable connectivity and location awareness is at an all-time high. The collaboration with Kudelski is taking advantage of this opportunity and will result in high-quality products and services that meet both current and future needs.<br />New product rundown<br />u-blox's strategy remains to provide a coherent range of products and services that are secure, easy to use, and of high quality. It is also an ongoing aim to continually increase the number of products that are built on its own silicon.<br />In our solution portfolio, we saw good growth in the area of cellular and short range products: LTE modules performed very strongly across the first six months of 2018, and we have seen continued growth in sales for Wi-Fi modules. By contrast, sales of positioning chipsets have slowed.<br />In keeping with its strategy, u-blox launched a variety of significant new products in 2018. Highlights include the u-blox F9 technology platform, which delivers high precision positioning solutions for mass market industrial and automotive applications; the UBX-P3 chip for vehicle to everything (V2X) wireless communication, and a new cellular technology called LTE Cat M1, specifically designed for the needs of applications targeting the Internet of Things (IoT) or machine-to-machine (M2M) communications.<br />Revenue by reporting segments<br />u-blox operates in two segments:<br />Positioning and wireless products<br />u-blox develops and sells chips and modules for positioning and wireless connectivity that are used in automotive, industrial, and consumer applications. Revenue was<br />CHF 198.9 million<br />for the first half of 2018 compared with<br />CHF 193.8 million<br />during the same period last year.<br />Wireless services<br />u-blox also offers wireless communication technology services in the form of reference designs and software. In the first semester, revenue for wireless services was<br />CHF 16.1 million<br /
