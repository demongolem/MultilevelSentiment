Russia's Gazprom Neft increased its second-quarter daily crude and condensate output by 2.4% on the quarter to 1.28 million b/d, due to rising production in Iraq and its increased share in Arcticgas, the company said Thursday.
In absolute volumes, Gazprom Neft's Q2 production rose by 3.4% on the quarter to 15.54 million mt, or 116.43 million barrels, based on its own conversion rate, it said in its Q2 financial results. The difference in percentage change is due to an extra day in Q2.
Growth came after Russia's leading company in terms of rate of increase in crude production. Gazprom Neft had been restricting its output growth in the preceding 18 months due to Russia's production cut deal with OPEC and other non-OPEC producers in effect since January 2017. The deal's participants agreed in June to start boosting output from July.
While holding back output at the least efficient assets, Gazprom Neft kept up output growth at greenfields, as well as at some mature assets where it managed to boost recovery rates with new technology.
The Q2 growth came mainly from Gazprom Neft's key producing projects abroad, Badra in Iraq and the Garmian block in Iraqi Kurdistan, which together showed a 30.3% quarter-on-quarter output rise to 330,000 mt, it said.
Domestically, the company also increased output across nearly all of its key assets, including its mature fields as the company focused on boosting efficiency and managed to cut its production costs at these fields, CEO Alexander Dyukov said in a statement.
"In an environment of curtailed oil production, the company has focused on increasing operating efficiency: industry trends and inflationary factors notwithstanding, Gazprom Neft reduced the unit costs of crude production at mature fields by 8% year on year," Dyukov said.
Liquids production at Khantos, which makes up more than a quarter of Gazprom Neft's total liquids production, rose by 0.6% on the quarter. Output at Noyabrskneftegaz, which accounts for another 17% of the company's production, jumped by 5.1%, the data showed.
However, production at both assets fell on the year. Liquids production at Khantos was down 1.7% on the year at 3.47 million mt in Q2. Output at Noyabrskneftegaz fell by 6% to 2.7 million mt.
The Orenburg asset, where the company has been actively implementing innovative technology to boost recovery rates, increased output by nearly 8% on the quarter.
In the first half of the year, however, the company's liquids output shrank by 0.5% on the year to 228.82 million barrels, or 1.264 million b/d, with all assets outside the Arctic and Middle East posting year-on-year drops.
Noyabrskneftegaz led the drop with an 11.6% fall, followed by Tomskneft and Orenburg. Year-on-year increases in production at the Arctic fields â€” 25% at the onshore Novy Port and by 3.7% at the offshore Prirazlomnoye â€” as well as a 27% rise in Iraq including the Kurdistan region partly offset the drop.
Hydrocarbons output rose 2.4% on the quarter to 1.85 million b/d of oil equivalent in Q2. In January-June, it increased by 2% on the year to 1.84 million boe/d. This was "driven by higher production at new fields (Novy Port and East Messoyakha) and an increase in Gazprom Neft's interest in Arcticgas" joint venture with Novatek in March to 50% from 46.4%, the company said.
Production in Q2 at the recently launched East Messoyakha field in the Arctic, developed in a 50:50 joint venture with Rosneft, rose 8% on the quarter, and H1 output rose nearly 50% on the year, the company said.
REFINING UP
Processing in H1 jumped nearly 10% on the year to 20.57 million mt, due to the low base in the first half of 2017, when the company's Moscow refinery underwent extensive modernization.
The company thus ensured "optimum refining volumes in current marketing conditions, and increasing sales of oil products," Dyukov said.
The company posted strong Q2 financial results, with net profit almost doubling year on year to Rb96.8 billion ($1.44 billion), and its free cash flow tripling to Rb36 billion.
