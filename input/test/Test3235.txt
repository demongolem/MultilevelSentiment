The Guardian Bunge committee presses government to refund sugar importers With the bill for 15% import guarantee fees on industrial sugar imports now at the 35bn/- mark, the onus is now on the state to reimburse importers who fulfilled the requirements
THE government has an obligation to refund a total of 35 billion/- in import guarantee fees to all industrial sugar importers who have submitted their audited financial reports for the past two years, a parliamentary committee asserted yesterday.
The 15 per cent guarantee fee on industrial sugar imports was introduced a couple of years ago in the wake of reports that some unscrupulous importers were repackaging the product and marketing it as ordinary sugar for households consumption after it entered the country.
But now it turns out that although the importer is entitled to a full fee reimbursement after submitting an audited report to prove that the sugar was indeed used for industrial production purposes, the government has yet to fulfil its end of the deal even after most of the importers submitted their reports as required.
This is according to the chairman of the Parliamentary Committee on Industry, Trade and Environment, Suleiman Sadiq, who was speaking to journalists yesterday after the committee completed an inspection tour of the Said Salim Bakhresa beverage industrial complex in Mwandege, Coast Region.
Said Sadiq: "(The import guarantee fee) was a welcome idea from the government, but we expected them to return the money to the compliant importers as required by law because this was part of their overall costs incurred."
The Bunge committee chairman was responding to claims by Said Salim Bakhresa Group of Companies (SSB) officials that the government's delay in refunding them over the last two years despite full compliance of the requirements has placed SSB operations in jeopardy.
"We depend on this money to keep our business in liquidity," SSB's group corporate affairs director Hussein Sufian Ally told the committee members.
The deputy minister for Trade and Industries, Stella Manyanya, said the ministry will work on the issue raised and strive to find an amicable solution to any hitches.
"We, as a government, are there to ensure that the laws that we enact correspond to our main agenda, which is industrialisation. This is why we listen to what industrial investors are saying," Manyanya stated.
President Magufuli personally gave 10,000 hectares of land to SSB after the company's owner, one of the country's most prominent business and industrial moguls, stated interest to establish a sugar producing factory.
SSB has said it will officially start producing sugar by July 2020 after the finalization of the plant construction process near Bagamoyo.
After initially announcing a total ban on sugar imports by private companies to protect local industries in February 2016, President Magufuli later declared a crackdown on traders who he accused of hiding sugar in their warehouses to create an artificial shortage.
Thousands of tonnes of sugar were impounded during the operation which saw the Magufuli government assume full control of the sugar importation trade
