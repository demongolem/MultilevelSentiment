Once, at an airport, I witnessed a man dressed as Santa leap out of a giant present at an airport, yell ''Ho ho ho â€” sorry about the volcanic ash'' and throw Violet Crumbles at delayed passengers.
You might be thinking ''what an annoying knob''. On the contrary, that ''activation'' won Best Surprise and Delight Campaign at the Saint-RaphaÃ«l Advertising Awards in 2013.
What is Surprise and Delight? Once a mere common noun and the exclusive domain of marketing departments, today it is entirely different. It is everybody's business.
Indeed, in 2018, if you're not Surprising and Delighting your customers, your stakeholders, your family and passersby, you're not taking your career seriously. And by you I mean you specifically. You need to make changes or risk becoming professionally and spiritually vacant. Lucky for you, you're reading the words of the world's foremost Surpriser and Delighter.
Here's my advice:
Advertisement Be straight. Say to people: ''I'm going to Surprise and Delight you now'' before you discuss their tax or take them through data retention laws.
Answer the phone doing your best Mrs Slocombe from Are You Being Served. That particular brand of double entendre humour is timeless and transcends cultural barriers.
Blast an air horn for no reason. They've been doing this in the US for decades; we need to swallow our pride and board that 130-decibel train.
The Delight comes from customers/birdwatchers/churchgoers discovering they haven't died of shock (Surprise).
Do things nude. I keep saying this on these pages â€” please trust me. People will be Surprised by your expression of vulnerability and Delighted by your dangles and squiggles
