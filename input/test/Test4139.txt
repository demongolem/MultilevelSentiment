Press release from: Market Research Future Cancer is the leading and the second largest cause of death across the globe. The disease is characterized by disordered and deregulated cellular and stromal explosion along with reduced cell death and growth factor deprivation, and others. Biological therapy treatment is done with the help of living organisms, parts of living organisms or laboratory manufactured version of such content. Various types of biological therapies, which inhibit specific molecules involved in development and growth of cancer tumor, such therapies known as; cancer targeted therapies.The major driving factors for Asia Pacific cancer biological therapy market are increasing cancer survival rates, growing demand for advanced therapies such as biological therapy, growth of cancer healthcare facilities in emerging countries, etc. Additionally, less number of side effects associated with biological therapy as compared to conventional treatment methods is the critical growth factor. Conventional cancer treatment methods like chemotherapy, radiotherapy give effective result, but along with that these methods also show its counter effects on body. The side effects may include, loss of hair, weakened immune system, and such others depending upon the type, and phase of cancer.
