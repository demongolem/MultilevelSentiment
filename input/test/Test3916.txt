The follow-on to Gundam Unicorn and the precursor to Hathaway's Flash , Gundam Narrative , is released this November. Set in U.C. 0097, a year after the events in Gundam Unicorn , despite the Laplace Incident not much has changed in the Earth sphere and both the Unicorn Gundam and Banshee have been locked away.
However, there is a third Unicorn type Gundam and that is now on the loose. Called the Phenex it is an incredibly powerful golden mobile suit and vested interests within the Federation government as well as Anaheim Electronics want it captured.
Thrown into this situation is Jona Bashta and the Narrative Gundam . The later is actually a cobbled together mobile suit that was originally meant as the testbed for the RX-93 Nu Gundam from Char's Counterattack .
The interesting thing in all this is while Miverva Zabi is very much present in Gundam Narrative , Banagher Links is conspicuously nowhere to be found.
Admittedly, he could be under house arrest due to being a powerful Newtype much like Amuro Ray was for some of Zeta Gundam , but it won't surprise me at all if he ends being the pilot of the Phenex.
In any case, Gundam Narrative is meant in part to help build out this part of the Universal Century timeline and try to connect Gundam Unicorn to the events of Hathaway's Flash .
Considering that Gundam Unicorn is part of the later novel timeline, tying that into Hathaway's Flash more concretely makes sense. Especially as we know an anime adaptation of that novel is on the way already.
Personally, I just like the fact that Hajime Katoki is trying to stylistically shift the mecha design closer to the more angular approach Moriki Yasuhiro used in Hathaway's Flash . You can partly see that in the creation of the mobile armor type platform Equipment A (shown above) and that's just great really.
Gundam Narrative is released in Japan on November 30.
