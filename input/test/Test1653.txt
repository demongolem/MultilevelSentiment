I'm not for going there and coming away with regrets and it being a shame.'<br />The Ibrox boss felt his side could have offered more incision in the first half but, after making it 10 games unbeaten under his command, he expressed pride in their overall progress.<br />Connor Goldson's first-half goal means Gerrard's men take a slender lead into the second leg<br />'I was disappointed with my team in the first 45 minutes,' he admitted. 'I didn't think we went through the gears, we were a bit flat. I thought we waited for the crowd to lift us. We asked the players to lift the crowd then go with the momentum.<br />'The second half was closer to what I want. We played with more intensity and purpose on the front foot.<br />'We kept them in their half for the majority of the second half. We just didn't get the rewards for how we played.<br />'The players have been magnificent up to now. We are on a good run but it's important to maintain that and try to improve on it.<br />'It's still early days but I suppose we are a bit further down the line than I thought.<br />'I've got nothing bad to say about my team. I'm proud of them so far.<br />Rangers have recorded clean sheets in each of their three previous away qualifiers<br />'Of course I would have liked a little bit more of an advantage and a better show in the first half but I have no criticism of them.'<br />Ufa's stuffy tactics were accompanied by 17 fouls before half-time, with Gerrard less than impressed by Polish referee Daniel Stefanski.<br />'There were five or six foul throws, players consistently fouling and not getting punished and two of my players make their first foul and get yellows,' said Gerrard, who saw Kyle Lafferty booked after his second-half introduction.<br />'I'm surprised. Refs at this standard are normally better than that.<br />'I won't talk about refs - it's not important now. It's done. But we could have had a better performance from him as well.'<br />RELATED ARTICLES<br /
