Press release from: QYResearch Co.Ltd PR Agency: QYR Global Small-Scale Liquefaction Market Insights, Forecast to 2025 This report presents the worldwide Small-Scale Liquefaction market sizeÃ‚ (value, production and consumption), splits the breakdown (data status 2013-2018 and forecast to 2025), by manufacturers, region, type and application.This study also analyzes the market status, market share, growth rate, future trends, market drivers, opportunities and challenges, risks and entry barriers, sales channels, distributors and Porter's Five Forces Analysis.One issue faced by the oil and gas industry was the transportation of gas. Eventually, liquefaction of gas became the norm of the industry to reduce its volume and transport it efficiently. Conversion of natural gas from gaseous to liquid form by decreasing its temperature is known as liquefied natural gas (LNG).The roadways market segment accounted for about 70% of the total market shares and dominated the industry. Roadways account for approximately one-fifth of the GHG emissions which have induced governments to promote the use of natural gas. Several countries have started adopting the usage of SSLNG as a replacement for diesel as the preferred fuel for long-haul trucks due to its low GHG emissions. Countries such as China and the US have already started adopting the usage of natural gas for automobiles on a large scale and the next few years will see a number of countries following this trend which will drive the growth of the market in this segment.Americas will dominate the small-scale liquefaction industry throughout the forecast period and will also account for about 70% of the total shares of the market by 2023. North America accounts for the majority of the revenue shares in this region wherein, backed by the government, the US is the major revenue contributor. Vendors in the US have also formed associations to spread awareness regarding the industry. Much of this regionÃ¢s growth comes from the transportation sector that includes both the roadways and maritime.The following manufacturers are covered in this report:Ã‚ Ã‚ Ã‚ Ã‚ Black & VeatchÃ‚ Ã‚ Ã‚ Ã‚ GEÃ‚ Ã‚ Ã‚ Ã‚ LindeÃ‚ Ã‚ Ã‚ Ã‚ ShellÃ‚ Ã‚ Ã‚ Ã‚ SiemensÃ‚ Ã‚ Ã‚ Ã‚ Chart IndustriesÃ‚ Ã‚ Ã‚ Ã‚ CryostarÃ‚ Ã‚ Ã‚ Ã‚ GTIÃ‚ Ã‚ Ã‚ Ã‚ WartsilaSmall-Scale Liquefaction Breakdown Data by TypeÃ‚ Ã‚ Ã‚ Ã‚ Direct LiquefactionÃ‚ Ã‚ Ã‚ Ã‚ Indirect LiquefactionSmall-Scale Liquefaction Breakdown Data by ApplicationÃ‚ Ã‚ Ã‚ Ã‚ RoadwaysÃ‚ Ã‚ Ã‚ Ã‚ BunkeringÃ‚ Ã‚ Ã‚ Ã‚ Power IndustryÃ‚ Ã‚ Ã‚ Ã‚ OtherSmall-Scale Liquefaction Production by RegionÃ‚ Ã‚ Ã‚ Ã‚ United StatesÃ‚ Ã‚ Ã‚ Ã‚ EuropeÃ‚ Ã‚ Ã‚ Ã‚ ChinaÃ‚ Ã‚ Ã‚ Ã‚ JapanÃ‚ Ã‚ Ã‚ Ã‚ Other RegionsÃ‚ Ã‚ Ã‚ Ã‚ Other RegionsThe study objectives are:Ã‚ Ã‚ Ã‚ Ã‚ To analyze and research the global Small-Scale Liquefaction status and future forecastÄ�Åºinvolving, production, revenue, consumption, historical and forecast.Ã‚ Ã‚ Ã‚ Ã‚ To present the key Small-Scale Liquefaction manufacturers, production, revenue, market share, and recent development.Ã‚ Ã‚ Ã‚ Ã‚ To split the breakdown data by regions, type, manufacturers and applications.Ã‚ Ã‚ Ã‚ Ã‚ To analyze the global and key regions market potential and advantage, opportunity and challenge, restraints and risks.Ã‚ Ã‚ Ã‚ Ã‚ To identify significant trends, drivers, influence factors in global and regions.Ã‚ Ã‚ Ã‚ Ã‚ To analyze competitive developments such as expansions, agreements, new product launches, and acquisitions in the market.Request Sample Report andÃ‚ TOC@Ã‚ www.qyresearchglobal.com/goods-1790544.html About Us:QY Research established in 2007, focus on custom research, management consulting, IPO consulting, industry chain research, data base and seminar services.
