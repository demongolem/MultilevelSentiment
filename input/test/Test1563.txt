The Naked Labs app lets you scrutinize all of your scans to help track and visualize the way your body changes over time.<br />Screenshots by Ry Crist/CNET<br />Yes, it's a super-expensive, first-of-its-kind gadget aimed at early adopters with money to burn. At $1,400, I don't imagine that very many of you reading this will rush to break the bank and buy one. But Naked Labs sees a future for this thing -- and the vision is perhaps more compelling than you might expect.<br />Like so much of the smart home, the Naked Labs scanner is all about gathering data and putting it to work. Aside from empowering users to monitor their bodies down to the last detail, Naked Labs sees the potential for users to share their data with healthcare providers, clothing manufacturers, researchers or even personal trainers you connect with via the app. One promo pic<br />on the Naked Labs website<br />even shows a personal trainer doodling on a user's scan to highlight areas of focus.<br />If you're starting to hear alarm bells ringing, I can't blame you. It's one thing to share data about how many times you turn the lights on and off with a tech startup -- it's quite another to share revealing images of your body. To its credit, Naked Labs seems to be doing its best to get ahead of privacy concerns like those with plain-spoken language about company standards front and center in the app. The aim? Assuaging your worries from the get-go.<br />Before your first use, the app makes a point of spelling out the company's standards for user privacy in plan English.<br />Screenshots by Ry Crist/CNET<br />"You might want to share your scans and metrics with the world, or you might not," the Naked Labs app reads during setup. "You own your account, scan data, and personal information and can delete it at any time."<br />However, the app also goes on to acknowledge that Naked Labs may anonymize and aggregate your data. "This helps us improve our services, develop new features, and derive insights like health or fitness trends in the population."<br />"We will never sell your personal information to third parties," the app adds. "Unless you opt to share anonymized data, no one at Naked Labs can view your scans."<br />Even if you're willing to give Naked Labs your trust, what happens if they get hacked?<br />"Our cloud servers are protected by industry standards," reads the Naked Labs privacy policy. "All scans and scan-derived data are encrypted, and your scan is decoupled from your personal information. This means that in the unlikely event of a data breach, there would be no way to link up scans with the identity of those scanned."<br />Unboxing the Naked Labs Body Scanner in the CNET Smart Home<br />First impressions<br />So far, the Naked Labs Body Scanner is working as promised. Setup was simple, thanks to the helpful, step-by-step directions in the app (if you're curious, I'll walk you through the process in that gallery above), and all of us have started taking regular scans.<br />This is an actual scan of myself on the phone with the scanner's tech support line.<br />Screenshot by Ry Crist/CNET<br />We did encounter one hiccup early in the testing process. After I had already created an account and run a couple of scans, my co-testers created accounts of their own on their own<br />phones<br />and tried to do the same. However, none of them were able to finish their first scan -- the scale would rotate, but the app would return a vague error message before sending the data off to be compiled and compressed.<br />I made a call to the customer support number in the Naked Labs app and was connected with a representative named Allie within a minute. Allie was helpful and informative -- in addition to the obvious first step of unplugging the thing and plugging it back in, she immediately recommended that we disable the<br />Bluetooth<br />on all of the devices we'd paired with the scanner save for the device of the person trying to do a scan. Apparently, Naked Labs had already identified an issue in multiuser homes where the scanner won't send data if it isn't completely sure which nearby device -- and user -- it's supposed to connect with.<br />If anything, that sounds like the Naked Labs software is erring on the side of caution with regard to user privacy, and that's a good thing -- you wouldn't want your scan ending up on someone else's device due to a Bluetooth mishap. At any rate, Allie's recommendation did the trick, and all of us were able to complete scans afterwards. She also told me that a software fix is in the works and due out in the coming weeks.<br />(Oh, and toward the end of our call, she asked me to try a quick test scan to make sure the thing was working. The result? A scan of myself on the phone with the scanner's tech support line. If that isn't a perfect promo image for the modern smart home, I don't know what is.)<br />As for the scans themselves, we're still in the process of putting them to them to the test, but so far, they seem highly detailed and remarkably accurate. Expect to hear -- and see -- a lot more about them when we publish our full review.<br />Reflecting forward<br />The Naked Labs Body Scanner might be the epitome of where smart home tech is at right now. Devices are seeking to put more and more of our personal data to use, and their success will ultimately depend upon our comfort level with that exchange. That level of comfort is continuing to evolve -- 10 years ago, I'd have never believed that millions of people would happily scatter always-listening microphones throughout their homes, but that's what's happening today, and devices like the<br /
