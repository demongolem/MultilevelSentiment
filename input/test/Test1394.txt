Their efforts will help feed 9,000 families in need.<br />&quot;Helping people is our top priority,&quot; said<br />Austin Bonn<br />, President of Sales for USAgencies.  &quot;Our employees are committed to making a difference â€” not just for our customers, but for all of our neighbors. When there's an opportunity to participate in a meaningful cause, they jump in with both feet.&quot;<br />And their enthusiasm is infectious, according to Bonn. &quot;They come back to the office talking about how much fun they had and how rewarding it is to be involved in a social action program.&quot;<br />The Greater Baton Rouge Food Bank strives to feed the hungry in<br />Baton Rouge<br />and surrounding parishes by providing food and educational outreach through faith-based and other community partners. The nonprofit organization has served the hungry in 11 areas for more than 30 years.<br />&quot;The Greater Baton Rouge Food Bank could not help those who struggle with food insecurity in our community without the assistance of our volunteers,&quot; said<br />Julianna Gentile<br />, the organization's Public Relations/Communications Coordinator. &quot;Last year, thanks to their hard work, time, and dedication, we distributed over 10 million pounds of food.&quot;<br />Volunteering is a great team building opportunity, added Gentile. &quot;It allows colleagues to work together while supporting a greater purpose â€” which in our case is fighting hunger. I think it's incredible that USAgencies employees take time from work to give back.&quot;<br />Confie's pledge to give back to the community and build a winning culture plays out in a variety of initiatives throughout the year. The company will once again be a national sponsor of the annual Toys for Tots drive taking place at the end of the year.<br />To get involved with the Great Baton Rouge Food Bank, please contact (225) 359-9940 or visit<br />.<br />About Confie<br />Established in 2008, Confie is a leading, national insurance distribution company primarily focused on personal lines and small commercial insurance.
