Indian Railways new time-table 2018: Soon, a train journey between Delhi and Chandigarh will be possible in just 3 hours! What's also good news for passengers is that this train journey will offer aircraft-like luxury and comforts! According to the new Indian Railways time-table 2018 that became effective from August 15, a new Tejas Express train will be introduced soon on the Delhi-Chandigarh route. This train will take just 3 hours to travel between the two cities. Tejas Express is Indian Railways luxury offering that will eventually replace Shatabdi Express trains on key routes. The new type of train was first introduced in 2017 on the Mumbai-Goa route. In total Indian Railways has identified three routes for the Tejas Express; Mumbai-Goa, Delhi-Chandigarh and Delhi-Lucknow. The latter two will start plying in a few months time.
Delhi-Chandigarh Tejas Express timings:
The new Delhi-Chandigarh Tejas Express, while part of last year's time-table, was not introduced because the rake had not been manufactured. The new upgraded rake of the Tejas Express has been manufactured by Rail Coach Factory, Kapurthala. The timings of the Delhi-Chandigarh Tejas Express have been changed in the new time-table. Last year, the train was scheduled to leave New Delhi at 9:40 AM to reach Chandigarh at 12:40 PM and on return journey would leave Chandigarh at 2:35 PM to arrive in Delhi at 5:30 PM.
However, according to the new Indian Railways time-table 2018, Train number 22425 will now depart from New Delhi at 6:30 AM every day (except Wednesday) to reach Chandigarh at 9:30 AM, taking a total of 3 hours. On the return journey, Train number 22426 will leave from Chandigarh at 5:55 PM to reach New Delhi at 8:55 PM on all days except Wednesday. With the new timings, the new Tejas Express will also greatly benefit business travellers who want to travel from Delhi to Chandigarh for a day's work.
