Some of the most vocal critics were women like Mrs. Arthur M. Dodge, the president of the National Association Opposed to Woman Suffrage.<br />In a lengthy article<br />published in The New York Times in 1913<br />, Mrs. Dodge railed about how suffrage could cause â€œstartling and radical changesâ€� to marriage, which she called â€œwomenâ€™s one protection.â€�<br />Marriage â€œwas designed for women, not men,â€� she went on. â€œWomen were created to fulfill certain functions in the human scheme,â€� she said. â€œIf she shirks them, not only women but the world will suffer.â€�<br />______<br /
