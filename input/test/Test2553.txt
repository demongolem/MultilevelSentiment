The search giant has launched a special 'Person Finder' page specifically for Kerala. It's a tool that tracks all missing persons in a tragedy, and helps reunite them with loved ones. Emergency responders and organisations on the ground in the disaster area can embed the tool in their websites. It lets people who have found a person separated from their family input their information. Loved ones searching for lost family members can then search through a database of all found people, in the hopes one of them is their own.

The tool was originally launched during Japan's massive earthquake in 2011 that damaged the Fukushima nuclear reactor. Between March and October 2011, it had gathered over 6,70,000 entries in the database, so clearly any possible success comes from people willing to populate and check the database.

In Kerala right now, people are scrambling to safety, with the Kochi airport closed until August 26 . Close to 1.65 lakh people have been forced out of their homes and into 1155 relief camps across the state. So if you're looking for a loved one in Kerala, here's how you can try using Google's Person Finder to do that.
You can find the link to the tool here . If you have information about a missing person, just click the corresponding button. It'll ask you to provide their first and last name, after which you have to click the button below to provide more details. This step provides a check, so that if someone else has already input information about that person it will prevent you from duplicating the entry. The additional details you can add include any alternate names, their age and sex, a message to the person's family, and their status (missing, found, etc). You can also include a general area or geotag for the last place they were seen.
If you're instead looking for someone, clicking that button on the main menu will take you to simple search box. Either a first or last name will work here, though obviously a full name would be better. If that person isn't in the database, it'll provide you with the option to create an entry for them.

You can also hit the option to subscribe to updates about that person, which will send you a notification if anything in the entry changes.
Be careful out there guys, and reach your loved ones safe
