Placental Insufficiency Treatment Market to Undertake Strapping Growth by the End 2026
Albany, Placental insufficiency is a complication of pregnancy, wherein the placenta is unable to deliver adequate nutrition to the fetus. Placenta is a highly complex circular organ in the uterus which keeps the baby alive and well during pregnancy by providing it food and oxygen. Placental insufficiency is also known as placental dysfunction. It is a rare but serious complication of pregnancy. Smoking and chronic high blood pressure are the two common causes of placental insufficiency. Besides, reduction in food intake of the mother, blood clotting disorder, drug abuse, preeclampsia, etc. are the other causes that can lead to placenta insufficiency. There are no maternal symptoms associated with placenta dysfunction; however, the mother may notice if the size of the uterus is smaller vis-Ã -vis different stages of pregnancy, if there is less movement of the baby, etc. Based on drug class, the global Placenta Insufficiency Treatment Market can be segmented into antiplatelet agents and anticoagulants. The antiplatelet agents segment is likely to expand at a significant pace during the forecast period. Antiplatelet agents, such as low molecular weight heparins, are generally preferred by doctors for treating placenta insufficiency as they have more pronounced antithrombotic activity. This is expected to boost the segment during the forecast period. In terms of distribution channel, the global placenta insufficiency treatment market can be divided into hospital pharmacies, medical stores, and others. The hospital pharmacies segment is expected to expand at a significant rate during the forecast period, as during the treatment, patients are required to visit the hospitals for routine checkup, and also, they find it convenient to buy drugs from hospital pharmacies. Increase in the number of female smokers in the developed and developing countries has led to different types of placenta issues during their pregnancy. This is one of the major factors fueling the global placenta insufficiency treatment market. However, limited awareness in the developing countries regarding the effect of placenta insufficiency on the baby and the mother during pregnancy is anticipated to hamper the market in the next few years.
