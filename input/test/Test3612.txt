Exiles boss aims to halt Taylor's flying start at Exeter Menu Newport County boss Michael Flynn backs Matt Taylor to take Exeter City up Andrew Penman 0 comments NEWPORT County AFC manager Michael Flynn believes former Exiles player Matt Taylor has a golden opportunity to win promotion in his first season as a manager with Exeter City â€“ but he's determined to put a spanner in the works this weekend.
Taylor, who played four games for County after being signed by Terry Butcher in 2015, replaced long-serving boss Paul Tisdale as Exeter boss this summer.
Life in the hot seat has started well for the 36-year-old with two wins from two putting the Grecians top of the embryonic League Two table.
And his side will be full of confidence having beaten Championship club Ipswich Town on penalties in the Carabao Cup on Tuesday night.
Having lost in the play-off final in the last two seasons, Flynn believes Taylor's men will be targeting automatic promotion this time round.
But he's confident that his side can give them a few problems at St James Park tomorrow afternoon.
"The new manager has come in and Matty will have them organised and full of confidence after the start they've had," said Flynn.
"Things will be slightly different to what they're used to but sometimes that can work in your favour.
"It's going to be a tough game. They've got a lot of good players and I bet they're hoping they can get in the top three so they don't have to go back to the play-offs. That's what I'd be thinking as a player at Exeter.
"They should be up there. The last two seasons they've got to the play-off final and not too much has changed with their squad.
"I know they've lost a couple but they've recruited well so they should be up there again."
Flynn did briefly work with Taylor (above) at Rodney Parade when he was brought in as a coach by Butcher's replacement Warren Feeney and before the veteran centre-back was released in February 2016.
"I know Matty," he said. "I came back in to do a bit of coaching before he left.
"He's somebody I get on well with and our paths have crossed when we've done reserve fixtures and last season when he was coaching their first team.
"He's a good lad who is keen to learn and improve and he's got his chance now.
"It's always difficult in your first job because you're the unknown quantity but he's at a good club with a good fan-base, good finance and a good academy so he's fallen on his feet with his first opportunity â€“ there are a lot harder ones out there.
"I wish him luck, after Saturday."
Flynn hopes to have David Pipe, Mark O'Brien and Andrew Crofts available to play tomorrow but Robbie Willmott's hamstring injury is likely to keep him on the sidelines.
The Exiles boss also confirmed that 34-year-old Pipe is combining his playing duties with fitness coaching this season.
"He's doing strength and conditioning work with the first team," said Flynn.
"The boys listen to him and it'll help David improve in that area. He's always looked after himself and that's helped him stay so fit.
"This allows him to dip his toe into it and see whether it's for him on the other side of the fence.
"I know he does personal training as well so he's doing a little bit of both and it can help him make his mind up for when his career finishes.
"But he's still a part of the squad as well and I thought he did well against Crewe.
