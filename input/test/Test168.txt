Cameron Bancroft has penned down a deal with Durham as their overseas player, the club confirmed on Friday (August 17). He will be available for the full season and will represent the club in all three formats.
Tom Latham, who is set to be a key figure in New Zealand's 2019 World Cup campaign, will miss out. "Cameron provides us with a very talented overseas signing who can bulk up our batting line up and help us compete for silverware," John Lewis, the head coach, said. "Tom Latham has done a great job for us over the past two seasons but we anticipate Tom being unavailable due to the World Cup in 2019, therefore we were delighted to be able to bring Cameron in.
"Cameron is a talented top order batsman and a great talent across all formats, he has the appetite and temperament for scoring big runs."
Bancroft was handed a nine-month ban by Cricket Australia for his involvement in the ball-tampering scandal in the Cape Town Test earlier this year. He appeared in the Northern Territory limited-overs Strike League in July after CA allowed the banned troika - Steve Smith, David Warner and Bancroft - to play grade cricket in Australia.
The opener, understandably, was pleased with an opportunity coming his way. "I am excited to join Durham for the 2019 county season. Having played at Emirates Riverside in 2017 I know what a great place it is to play cricket," Bancroft gushed. "With the Ashes and ODI World Cup both being played in the UK in 2019 it will be a huge summer of cricket. I am grateful for the opportunity and I can't wait to get over and make an impact with Durham," he added. Â© Cricbuz
