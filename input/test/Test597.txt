As Leroy Sane started another season at Manchester City on the bench, it was hard not to think why.
The headlines could have been written before the game as LETHAL LEROY SILENCES LOEW to mark an end to his World Cup upset and remind everyone why his peers voted him the best young player in the Premier League last season.

Having been eased in during his first season, Sane's return from exile last year came against West Brom in the Carabao Cup, Palace in the league and Shakhtar in the Champions League before the reward of Chelsea away; he starred in all of them. Read Mor
