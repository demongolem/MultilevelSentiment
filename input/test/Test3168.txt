in General It might just be the cross-over Dem voters who stay home. Avid and yellow-dog Dems, and possibly even new, revved-up Dem voters, might turn out to vote, along with the most committed Republicans. That is how it usually is in the midterms; the party loyalists are the ones who show up.That is really all the parties want, i.e. the loyalists who do not expect any change, with the addition of a few non-loyalist voters to put the careerist politicians over the victory line. Lifetime - Loyalty - Party - Meh - Weakness Once you cross over, abandoning a lifetime of loyalty to a party, it is like, meh, do I really want to vote for them again? You have admitted the fundamental weakness in your party after going through the motions to vote them, like an obedient yellow dog, in midterms and general elections all of your life.You crossed over, thinking the other party might present an actual alternative. Do you really want to do this civic chore for them again or for the careerists in the other half of the Uniparty that you always voted for in vain? Anomaly - Voters - Half - Uniparty - Half I may be an anomaly, but if the cross-over voters who always showed up to vote, like me, do not show up at all, the blue half of the Uniparty has to subtract us, but the red half of the Uniparty cannot add us, canceling out our impact.But some people who never voted before turned out for Trump. Will they perform the chore of mid-term voting? These elections turn on 1%, especially since so few voters show up in the midterms. If the newly-registered crowd shows up again for Trump, it could sway it. But what motivated them?Republicans did not build a wall to stop illegal immigration. They did not do anything about reducing the number..
