Horoscopes THINGS CANCER MADE ME SAY Screening for bowel cancer at 50 is a victory â€“ but you MUST learn the 5 red-flag signs of the disease
Last week the Government agreed to lower the bowel cancer screening age from 60 to 50 - after The Sun launched the No Time 2 Lose campaign Comment 17th August 2018, 10:00 10:00 am
POWER to the people, power to US!
This week I've realised just what's possible if we all stick together and shout at the same time. Deborah James We did it! The Government HAS agreed to lower the bowel cancer screening age from 60 to 50 Leela Bennett While screening is a vital, it is only half the battle. It is important everyone knows the signs and symptoms to watch out for, to lower their risk
When we all shout loud enough, we really can make ourselves heard.
I've realised when people tell you something can't be done, that's when you have to shout even louder.
I am in awe of Lauren Backler, the 27-year-old who has turned her mum's death into a huge force for change.
Her mum, Fiona, died of bowel cancer three years ago , and her loss became Lauren's inspiration to make a difference. Lauren Backler 8 Lauren Backler started a petition calling for bowel cancer screening to start at 50 after losing her mum Fiona to the disease at 55
To make sure no other family has to face what hers has, losing their mum at just 55 years old, to a disease that can be cured, if it's caught early enough.
Lauren believes that had her mum been screened for bowel cancer from the age of 50, she would still be here today.
It's already 50 in Scotland, but us lot south of the border in England, Wales and Northern Ireland have been at the mercy of a postcode lottery, having to wait another ten years before having routine tests every two years. Jon Bond - The Sun 8 Lauren is an inspiration, without her this wouldn't have happened
At The Sun we got behind Lauren's petition, joining forces with her and leading charity Bowel Cancer UK , to pile the pressure on the powers that be with our No Time 2 Lose campaign.
We believed that by shouting loudly and together we could make a change.
And we have!
Last Friday, the Government announced it WILL lower the screening age to 50 , after doctors agreed it will save lives.
It means six million people will be included in the NHS screening programme - that's more than an extra 4,500 lives a year potentially saved.
The announcement comes after the Department of Health agreed to introduce the new FIT test, which makes screening easier, and more effective.
It's reduced the process from three poo samples, to just one - so there really is no excuse not to do it.
Screening is so important because it helps diagnose people in the earliest stages. Deborah James We joined forces with Lauren and Bowel Cancer UK to put pressure on the Government to listen THE NO TIME 2 LOSE CAMPAIGN IT'S A WIN! Victory for The Sun as bowel cancer screening age is lowered from 60 to 50 'COULD'VE SAVED MUM' BBC star backs Sun call for bowel cancer screening at 50 NOT 60 #NOTIME2LOSE Dad's bowel cancer is terminal - he's proof screening must start at 50 NOT 60 MUM'S THE WORD I have to be dad on Father's Day after bowel cancer stole my husband 'TIME IS PRECIOUS' I'm spending Father's Day as if it's my last - after bowel cancer struck DAD'S DAY Football legends urge all dads to learn bowel cancer signs after personal ordeals STEP UP Matthew Wright put through his paces by The Sun on air for bowel cancer campaign THE SUN'S WRIGHT Matthew Wright backs Sun's bowel cancer campaign after dad's death at 53 DEBORAH JAMES Get fit WITHOUT spending loads - it's one simple thing that can stop cancer NO TIME 2 LOOS How often do YOU go to the loo? What's normal and when it's a serious sign #NOTIME2LOSE The 1 simple thing you can do every day to slash your risk of bowel cancer DEBORAH JAMES Exercise got me through my darkest cancer days but it can help you PREVENT it
If you catch bowel cancer at stage one, a patient has a 97 per cent chance of living five years or more.
But at stage 4 - when mine was caught - that chance falls right off a cliff to just seven per cent.
So, after all that Lauren and Bowel Cancer UK have done to make this change, all you 50-year-olds owe it to them to actually do the test, and lower you risk of ever having to face this b*stard disease.
But, screening isn't the only way we can ensure early diagnosis.
And while it's great that so many more people will now be checked, it's vital that every single person in this country knows the signs and symptoms of bowel cancer. Jon Bond - The Sun Lauren handed her petition to the Department of Health in April this year, complete with more than 400,000 signatures
It is a disease that typically affects people over the age of 50.
But I was 35 when it came calling at my door.
I am, and sadly countless others, are all the proof you need that you're never too young to develop bowel cancer.
That's why our No Time 2 Lose campaign also aims to raise awareness of the signs of the disease. Deborah James Bowel cancer screening is a vital part of saving lives, but it is really important everyone knows the signs of the disease - I was diagnosed at 35, proof you're never too young
Yes, we have lots more to do.
This is only the start, we now need to ensure that a comprehensive plan is put in place to roll out screening from 50 ASAP.
But, before we get shouting again, I want to say thank you, thank you to everyone who signed Lauren's petition, to everyone who shared their story, to everyone who has worked so hard to shout about this.
