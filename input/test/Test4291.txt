UX Designer and Researcher at Opentrends Aug 17 Guessing User Needs: Smart Suggestions and Default States Dan Safer in his book 'Microinteractions' remarks how important is to guess what the users need based in their actions as mouse movements, clicks, selections, previous dataâ€¦ One of his microinteractions design principles is 'Don't Start From Zero', which encourages us to know about the user, the context, or the platform that can change the product for the better. We almost always know something, especially behavioural data so the product can be adapted to be used without resorting to manual settings and suggesting the best information and options. Let's see some examples that follows this principle: 1. If the user is scrolling up or down though an article too fast maybe he is not about to read at that moment, so we can suggest him reading it later. Example: When you are scrolling up while are reading an article at New Yorker, you get a message asking if you want to finish later. Source: Little Big Details 2. When an user is browsing on a specific profile in any social network, it can mean is interested in the profile and we can suggest to follow him or being notified when he makes updates. Example: iOS Tumblr suggest to receive notifications if you visit some Tumblr user page for a while. Source: Little Big Details 3. When an user creates an event/meeting using titles as lunch, dinner, breakfastâ€¦ we will try to show by default the typical time for those events. We can alway be wrong for some users but probably you will make most of them happier. Google calendar shows dinner time by default when the event title is 'Dinner'. Source: Little Big Details 4. When in a online conversation you write 'Where are you?' Most probably you are interested in the location. Google Hangouts shows share location options when someone ask 'where are you?'

If the message is personal, the initial part will have a name that sometimes we need to edit by hand. As UX we have to make automatic that task. In Airbnb when you copy/paste the same host message starting by 'Hello [host tname]', the name is changed by the host first name where your are copping it. Source: Little Big Details 6. If you try to go somewhere that have some specific opening hours and you will arrive almost when is close, you have to guess the user can arrive when is closed. Google Maps notifies you when your destination will be closing within an hour of when you arrive. Source: Little Big Details 7. If someone selects and copy a product name may is trying to compare the price in another page (this guess could be validated by following what the user is doing after coping). ao.com offers a price match tooltip if you select the appliance name/model.

It can be better to show directly the measures related with the country IP, but can be an issue if you are traveling in a place with a different measure. That why we should always offer the option to change. In Google Weather, when you change temperature metric to Celsius, the wind speed automatically changes to kilometers.
