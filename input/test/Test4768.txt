KUALA LUMPUR: The RapidKL bus driver who was responsible for ramming several vehicles along Jalan Ampang was high on methamphetamine, Bernama tweeted citing City police chief Datuk Seri Mazlan Lazim on Friday.
This follows a urine test conducted on the 32-year-old suspect.
Police arrested the suspect after he was discharged from the Ampang Hospital, where he was being treated for his injury.
He is expected to be remanded on Saturday (Aug 18).
On Thursday (Aug 16) night, footage of a RapidKL bus ramming into several vehicles on a busy road in Ampang has been going viral on social media and messaging apps.
The one-and-a-half minute footage shows the bus being pursued by several motorcycles, whose riders are heard shouting expletives at the driver and telling him to stop.
The bus is shown weaving recklessly through traffic before ramming into two cars but continues its rampage.
It rams into several other vehicles nearly 100m after the first collision and is then caught in gridlocked traffic.
