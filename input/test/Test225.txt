An event will be held in Oban next week to enable graduates in Argyll and Bute to find out more about becoming qualified secondary school teachers without the need to move away from the area.
Argyll and Bute Council has been working in partnership with the universities of Dundee and the Highlands and Islands to agree a programme, recently approved by the General Teaching Council of Scotland, which will see student teachers based in schools over an 18-month period.
An information evening earlier this summer proved popular, and as a result a second has been arranged to take place at the Corran Halls on Thursday August 23 from 5pm to 7pm, and can be attended on a drop-in basis for those unable to make it for 5pm.
Successful applicants will receive funding provided by the Scottish Government , and students will be able to study locally while spending a substantial time in class under the guidance of a mentor.
Subjects being offered are chemistry, computing, home economics, maths and physics â€“ all of which are experiencing a shortage of teachers.
On completion of the course, students will be awarded a post-graduate diploma in education and will be registered secondary teachers, able to immediately apply for jobs.
Councillor Yvonne McNeilly said: 'This scheme is a wonderful opportunity for young people in Argyll and Bute to become fully qualified secondary teachers, while having the chance to stay in the area. It also complements our existing teacher training scheme which saw 13 students gain their diploma in primary education last year.
'We want the best for our young people and we are committed to training, attracting and keeping the highest calibre of teaching staff in Argyll and Bute. Teacher training and recruitment is a national programme, so we welcome this exciting initiative to nurture home grown secondary teachers.'
Applications for the programme are open with a closing date of September 3. Interviews will take place on Thursday September 27, with the first intake of students in December.
People from other areas of Argyll and Bute who are interested can link in via video conference by prior arrangement. Contact the Oban education office on 01631 569192 for further details. Read more about: Oban Get our latest stories delivered to your inbox daily.
