A mum has slammed Poundland for selling babygrows, which she says are sexist and reinforce gender sterotypes.
Jessica Fealty, 27, saw the Â£1.50 Pep and Co babygrows featuring the slogans 'born to be spoiled' and 'future boss' in the Stroud branch on August 1.
But the 'bemused' company has hit back, insisting both items can be worn by either sex and saying they have won praise for them being 'gender neutral'. Jessica said the babygrows reinforce gender stereotypes (Picture: Mercury Press & Media)
Jessica, from Stroud, Gloucestershire, said: 'It's amazing how gendered they are from such a young age.
'I really don't want my daughter to think her only purpose in life is to be spoiled.
'I want her to be able to do anything she wants whether that's being an athlete or a rocket scientist. Jessica Fealty, 27, with her children Ziggy Fealty, three, and Marianne Fealty, one (Picture: Mercury Press & Media)

'I think it's sending out the message that a woman's purpose is to be spoiled and men's is to be a boss.
'These messages they receive from a young age are building women up to think they're less than men.
'It makes me sad that retailers continue to make these clothes.' Jessica slammed the chain for selling the clothes (Picture: Mercury Press & Media)
The white baby grows were displayed side by side with the slogan 'born to be spoiled' in pink writing with a crown above it and the 'future boss' written in bold black and red text.
Jessica says the slogans pigeonhole boys and girls, adding: 'Go into any shop and you'll see the clothes in the girl's section are pinks, purples, turquoises while in the boy's they're bold colours â€“ blues, blacks and red.
'It reinforces lazy gender stereotypes from such a young age â€“ stereotypes that we should be breaking down.'

Stay-at-home mum Jessica, who has two children Ziggy, three, and Marianne, one, said: 'I was the only woman doing my university course.
'Boys and girls have the same brain. You can be a male rocket scientist or a female rocket scientist.
'There are not enough men in care roles and women in science and this is not going to help that.' But Poundland said the criticism had left them 'bemused' (Picture: Danny Lawson/PA Wire)
Jessica said there is research to suggest mothers have their own subconscious sexism, only letting boys climb trees and get dirty. Advertisement Advertisement
She said: 'It harms everybody, this idea that boys need to be strong and determined.
'We've come so far in terms of equal rights but they're still determined to stick children into boxes. Children shouldn't be pigeonholed and shouldn't be aware of gender stereotypes.
'They're the same and there's no reason why until about the age of five boys and girls can't wear the same clothes.
'Shops have a duty to consider the messages they're sending to young children and consider selling more gender neutral clothing.'
A spokeswoman on behalf of Pep and Co and Poundland said: 'We're a bit bemused â€“ not least because our 'future boss' baby grow was praised last week online for being gender neutral.
'These don't stereotype. We know girls can be future bosses, and boys can be born to be spoiled.' Got a story for Metro.co.uk?
