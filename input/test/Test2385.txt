School principals recognize their unique positions as digital evangelists and are evolving to lead their schools into a new era of learning, according to new data on school leadership.
New data from Project Tomorrow's Speak Up survey, packaged in a report along with Blackboard, shows that the "new" school principal has skills and values that "inherently emphasize the importance of personalized learning and effective school-to-home communications."
