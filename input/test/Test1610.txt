I profiled Lisa Brennan-Jobs<br />, Steve Jobsâ€™s first child, whose memoir â€œSmall Fryâ€� comes out this fall. She is the one whose paternity he denied until the government sued him for child support, the one whose tuition fees he stopped paying after she offended him, the one whose mother lived on welfare even as her fatherâ€™s wealth grew.

As she lays out the details of his cruelty to make this argument, the question for readers is: Can we forgive him, too?<br />One scene I couldnâ€™t include in the profile because of space is when she decided to call him â€œdad.â€� She was 28 years old.

She asked him, and he said yes. No one else in her family commented on the change.<br />The book shows how she was made to feel almost illegitimate as a child, and some people are saying it shows she suffered from emotional abuse. One thing it shows clearly is that as she grows up, as she reaches the peak of adulthood and a life far from mercurial parents, though paternity is denied and erased for decades, she still wants that simple bond â€” on her own terms.<br />California Online<br />Representative Duncan Hunter, left, leaving an arraignment hearing in San Diego on Thursday.<br />Credit<br />(Please note: We regularly highlight articles on news sites that have limited access for nonsubscribers.)<br />â€¢ Representative<br />Duncan Hunter<br />and his wife have pleaded not guilty to allegations of widespread misuse of campaign funds.
