A student is studying the impact of students on Bath and YOU can participate He hopes to put a research report together that may lead to academic publication Share
A student is studying the impact of students in Bath and would like residents to come forward and participate in his research.
Ed Harding, 21, is inviting locals to share their thoughts on how students are changing the city .
Mr Harding, who is from Bath but studying in Liverpool, is focusing his research on the Oldfield Park area of the city.
He said: "It is well known in Bath there has been an increase in homes of multiple occupancy and student numbers .
"My study seeks the opinions of residents in Oldfield Park , an area of Bath highly populated by students .
"The study is interested in how the neighbourhood, community and high-street has changed.
"I am also interested in the residents' opinions on how seriously they think the council are concerned about the issue and what they would like to see happen." Ed Harding, 21, is investigating the impact of students on the city of Bath
Mr Harding is looking for as many responses as possible to his survey and has praised those who have responded already.
He said: "People have provided me with some really passionate responses."
The survey takes around ten minutes to complete and responses will form part of a research report and could lead to academic publication. Homes in Oldfield Park (Image: Artur Lesniak/Trinity Mirror)
Addressing any concerns that he might be student bashing, Mr Harding said: "I would like to add that although the survey may come across as blaming the students, this is not the intention of my research.
"Separate to the survey, I have interviewed multiple people on the wider issues in Bath that are perhaps sometimes ignored.
"The survey is to highlight what life is like and how it has changed for residents in Oldfield Park.
"I am then using interviews to explore how the issues highlighted in the survey have deeper roots and causes than just being simply down to the impact of having students in the area."

Mr Harding is not the first person to address the impact of students on the city.
Hundreds have signed a petition urging Bath and North East Somerset Council to address the 'student crisis' in the city.
The petition calls on the council to tackle problems caused by 'the ever increasing influx of students to Bath '.
Joe Scofield, who lives in Twerton , has created a petition on the 38 Degrees campaign website to drum up support for his movement.
Since starting is has amassed 562 signatures. The petition set up by Joe Scofield to 'address the student crisis in Bath'
The University of Bath and Bath Spa University are the only two universities in the city and cater for thousands of students respectively.
Mr Scofield claims that his petition is not an attack on the students that attend these universities. Instead, it is a message to the council urging it to do something about the numbers of students in the city.
He writes: "The council must either use the powers that it has, or lobby the government for greater powers to resolve these problems."
Twerton is used as a case in point throughout his petition, in which he outlines his reasoning.

An ex-student has spoken of how 'unwelcome' he was made to feel by residents during his time at Bath Spa University.
Alex Sykes, 22, was responding to the online petition set up to address the 'student crisis' in the city.
For Mr Sykes, however, the issue isn't simply one that can be blamed on students . In fact, he believes they are often used as a scapegoat.
He said: "Soon after I moved to the city it was quite apparent that students were not welcome here and that the main cause of this (among other concerns) was housing." Read More
Addressing the author of the online petition, a Mr Joe Scofield, the ex-student argued that having universities in the town is also a huge benefit.
He said: "I think the issue that Mr Scofield raises is almost a double standard however.
"It appears that residents of Bath would rather see housing estates of affordable housing as opposed to student accommodation which of course means more HMOs if there isn't the student accommodation needed.
"I do believe the universities and the council could do more to accommodate the ever growing population here in Bath. I do know however that the students here do bring a vast amount to the local economy and I do think that sometimes the local residents forget that."
