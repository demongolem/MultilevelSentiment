Netanyahu's New Security Doctrine to Boost Defense Spending by â€ŽBillions August 16, 2018 0
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Wednesday â€Žpresented the cabinet with his new security doctrine â€Žfor Israel, which entails increasing defense spending by â€Žbillions of shekels. â€Ž
The "2030 security concept," which has been in the works for two years, covers issues â€Žsuch as the regional threats Israel is likely to â€Žface in the coming decade, the necessary military â€Žbuildup, and updated defense and security â€Žprinciples. It addresses bolstering Israel's offensive and cyber â€Žcapabilities, upgrading missile â€Ždefenses, continued reinforcement of the homeâ€Žfront, and the completion of all security fences.â€Ž
The Prime Minister's Office said the full â€Ždocument is classified. Netanyahu will soon present â€Žit to the Knesset Subcommittee on Intelligence â€ŽAffairs and Secret Services, the IDF General Staff, â€Žthe Mossad and the Shin Bet security agency.â€Ž
Israel's longstanding defense doctrine has not been â€Žrevised in years, and Netanyahu formulated the outline â€Žafter lengthy consultations with top former and current defense â€Žofficials.
The plan will demand an increase to defense â€Žspending in the coming decade, Netanyahu said. â€Ž
According to the plan, the military will continue â€Žits streamlining process but the budget for Israel's intelligence agencies will â€Žincrease by 0.2-0.3 percent to reach 6 percent of gross â€Žnational product.â€Ž
The outline stipulates that the additional â€Žfunds, estimated at 3 billion to 4 billion shekels â€Žâ€Ž($815 million-$1 billion) per year, will be channeled â€Žto the Shin Bet and the Mossad. â€Ž
Once Israel's GNP reaches $500 billion, the ratio of defense spending â€Žwill be re-examined.â€Ž GNP reached $347.8 â€Žbillion in 2017.
The overall increase in defense spending over the â€Žâ€Žnext decade is expected to reach NIS 100 billion â€Žâ€Žâ€Ž($27 billion). â€Ž
The budgetary implications, which are not â€Žclassified, will soon be â€Žsubmitted for cabinet â€Žapproval, the Prime Minister's Office said on its â€Žwebsite.â€Ž
â€Ž"Due to our small area, the population concentration â€Žand the numerous threats around us, Israel will â€Žalways have security needs that are much greater â€Žthan any other state of similar size," Netanyahu â€Žsaid Wednesday.â€Ž
â€Ž"Today, the Israeli economy is strong enough to â€Žallow for this increase and in any case this â€Žincrease will be enacted while maintaining a â€Žresponsible budgetary framework.â€Ž
"In the last 20 years, we â€Žhave cultivated a free economy in order to serve â€Žnational needs, especially security. Faced with â€Žaccumulated threats, we are at a turning point. â€ŽToday we are called upon to invest more in security â€Žin order to defend our achievements and ensure â€Žcontinued economic growth. â€Ž
â€Ž"The combination of our security and economic â€Žstrengths will increase Israel's status as an asset â€Žin the eyes of other countries and thereby increase â€Žour diplomatic strength," Netanyahu said.
A source in the Finance Ministry said the government "has yet to find the budgetary sources to support the â€Žfinancial aspects of the defense doctrine. It was â€Žagreed at the cabinet meeting that in the next â€Žmeeting the Finance Ministry will present the â€Žimplications of this move and its potential impact â€Žon social budgets." â€Ž â€� â€
