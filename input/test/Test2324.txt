Exposing the role that Islamic jihad theology and ideology play in the modern global conflicts Germany: Muslim migrant rapes 14-year-old girl in downtown Hamburg Aug 16, 2018
Why does this keep happening?
Sexual assault occurs in all cultures, but only in Islam does it have divine sanction.
One survivor of a Muslim rape gang in the UK said that her rapists would quote Quran to her, and believed their actions justified by Islam.
The Qur'an teaches that Infidel women can be lawfully taken for sexual use (cf. its allowance for a man to take "captives of the right hand," 4:3, 4:24, 23:1-6, 33:50, 70:30). The Qur'an says: "O Prophet, tell your wives and your daughters and the women of the believers to bring down over themselves of their outer garments. That is more suitable that they will be known and not be abused. And ever is Allah Forgiving and Merciful." (33:59) The implication there is that if women do not cover themselves adequately with their outer garments, they may be abused, and that such abuse would be justified.
"Young girl raped in downtown Hamburg," translated from "Junges MÃ¤dchen in der Hamburger Innenstadt vergewaltigt," Die Welt , August 12, 2018:
At Hamburg central station, a man spoke to a 14-year-old. She did not react, but the man followed her and raped her a little later. She succeeded in getting help only after a subway ride.
A 14-year-old has been raped in a house on the MÃ¶nckebergstraÃŸe. The girl was approached on Saturday morning at the central station by a man, said the police. The teenager continued on her way, but the man followed her and involved her again and again in a conversation. In the MÃ¶nckebergstraÃŸe, the 30-year-old Afghan man is said to have pulled the girl into a house entrance and raped her there.
After the crime, he followed the 14-year-old further into the subway to a gas station near the HoheluftbrÃ¼cke subway station, where she asked for help. The police were able to arrest the suspect. A breath alcohol test was reported to be greater than 2.2 parts per thousand. The police-known 30-year-old should come before a magistrateâ€¦. Share this
