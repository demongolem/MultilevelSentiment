In Dubai, off the coast where the "Jumeirah Beach Residence"(JBR) complex is located, Meraas Holding is currently developing "Bluewaters Island", an artificial luxury island. Once completed, this man-made island will not only house premium apartments, penthouses, townhouses and close to 200 retail and dining concepts but also the world's largest Ferris wheel in the world. "Ain Dubai" is the name of the 260 meter high observation wheel, which is being built at a total volume of 240 million Euros and scheduled to be opened in due time for "Expo 2020" in October of that year. Featuring 48 air-conditioned luxury cabins for a total of 1,400 visitors, the wheel's travel time will be 48 minutes, offering guests astonishing views of popular sights such as Dubai Marina, Burj Khalifa or Burj Al Arab. With a height of 260 meters, Ain Dubai will surpass current record-holder "High Roller" in Las Vegas, which is 167 meters high ( cp. EAP news f. 29 April 2014 ).
