Print This Dzifa Aku Attivor is a former Minister of Transport A former Minister of Transport in the National Democratic Congress (NDC) government, Madam Dzifa Aku Attivor, has launched her campaign for the NDC chairmanship position in the Volta Region, with the promise to rebrand the party into a vibrant political entity. Madam Attivor, launching her campaign and manifesto at the Ho Central Market, said she was on a mission to rejuvenate the NDC in the region after the painful defeat in the 2016 elections and to also rebuild a formidable base for the party to recapture political power in the 2020 elections. She noted that the NDC, now in opposition, needed a fresh crop of dedicated and committed leaders who would work to strengthen the party's structure and organs in the region. "We are aware the Volta Region is the party's world bank, and it is therefore necessary to have the kind of leadership that will build the party with the capacity to stand the test of time,"she stated and expressed her readiness to serve the interest of the NDC at all levels when given the nod as the first woman regional chairperson. The former minister, who currently chairs the women working committee of the party in the region, is in a two horse race for the chairmanship position with the incumbent, Mr John Gyapon Kudjo, in the party's upcoming regional congress slated for September 1, 2018. Time for women The party, she noted, had come of age to have women playing commanding roles at the helm of affairs, stressing that "men have led this party since its inception but I believe the time has come for us women to take charge and lead the NDC into the future." She thus appealed to the party delegates to support her make history,stressing that she had the clout to unite and give hope to the party's branches,connect the party back to the cadres, get women to be part of the new NDC, attract first-time voters into the NDC, as well as build a strong partnership with the media in the region. Madam Attivor in her eight-page manifesto also pledged to champion the expansion of the foreign branches of the NDC into neighbouring Togo and Benin in order to attract Ghanaians in those countries to support the party. Failed NPP Administration The former Transport Minister said it was evident Ghanaians were yearning for the return of the NDC in 2020 due to the failure of the governing New Patriotic Party (NPP) to deliver on its unrealistic promises made during the 2016 electioneering. According to her "The people of Ghana are no longer ready for President Nana Akuffo Addo beyond 2020 and they are yearning for the return of NDC. The NPP in opposition made promises to transform our country but all we see is one family destroying the solid foundation Mahama and the NDC laid. Ghanaians disappointed The mood in Ghana today is that of disappointment and regret. Apart from President Akufo-Addo's family and friends, all Ghanaians, including NPP members, say; we are living in the worse period and most incompetent government of the Fourth Republic." "Our Women in the Ho market, Dzemeni, Asafo and Aboabo market in Tamale are in that state. Our shallot farmers in Anloga, our tomato farmers in Ziope are ready to vote for the NDC in 2020," she added and charged all party faithful to help position NDC recapture power in the next elections.
