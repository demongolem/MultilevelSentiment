Rising Singaporean boxing star Muhamad "The Chosen Wan" Ridhwan will face the toughest test of his young career when he goes up against former world champion Paulus Ambunda for the International Boxing Organisation (IBO) super bantamweight world title on September 29.
The two met for the first time at a press event on Thursday (August 16), and there are high hopes for Ridhwan.
The 30-year-old will follow in the footsteps of boxing stars Manny Pacquiao, Anthony Joshua and Gennady Golovkin if he does manage to defeat the Namibian for the vacant title at Marina Bay Sands next month.
Upon winning, he would actually join Joshua and Golovkin on the roster of IBO's current champions, with the two holding the heavyweight and middleweight titles respectively.
Joshua will be defending his IBO title just a week after Ridhwan's bout against Alexander Povetkin, a title commonly recognised as the biggest outside of the "Big 4" in boxing.
Ridhwan is currently undeafeated , earning a shot at the title after beating Filipino Jeson Umbal for the IBO intercontinental featherweight title in April.
He faces a stern challenge in the 38-year-old Ambunda, who was a former IBO super bantamweight champion back in 2015. He held the title for almost a year before losing it.
Also on the same fight card, named "Roar of Singapore: The Kings of Lion City" are bouts between undefeated boxers Keng Fai and Abdelelah Karroum, and Malaysian Mirage Khan facing off against Jonathan Taylor.
