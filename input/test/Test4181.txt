The sinking of the Titanic is one of the most well-known disasters in history, and has sparked the imagination and curiosity of many people, from historians to oceanographers and filmmakers. Now people will be able to explore the story of the Titanic through virtual reality (VR) with the official launch of Titanic VR .
Titanic VR first began back in early 2017 as a Kickstarter project. VR Education aimed to create an entertaining and educational experience that not only told the story of the disaster, but also let users explore the wreck in detail.
The title is split into two sections. The first lets users experience the events aboard ship on the night of the disaster through the eye of one of the lucky passengers who survived. VR Education say that the title features an animated experience that has been designed to be as immersive and historically accurate as possible, based on testimony of survivors of the tragedy.
The second section has used motion capture technology along with extensively details maps of the shipwreck in order to create an accurate 3D depiction of the wreck of the Titanic. This forms the basis for an educational-focussed videogame where players are set the task of navigating the wreck using a submersible and ROV in order to retrieve artefacts of historical significance, all of which are based on real objects that were retrieved from the wreck.
David Whelan, CEO of VR Education, said: "I am delighted to launch Titanic VR following the success of Apollo 11 , which has been downloaded over 130,000 times since its launch in 2016. Titanic VR is a factually animated experience that tells the famous story of the sinking of RMS Titanic as witnessed by survivors. As well as creating a realistic VR experience that tells the story of the tragedy in a compelling way, the game will also serve as a valuable resource for discovering more about the stricken ship through a realistic exploration experience, using detailed maps and 3D models of the historic wreck site. We have used motion capture, face-scanning technology and professional voice actors to immerse users in the story and enable them to relate to the people involved. In developing this we wanted to create an accurate portrayal of events, so it is not only educational, but also emotional and very engaging. We are confident that Titanic VR will be a great success and will update investors on early-stage demand at the time of the Group's interim results."
