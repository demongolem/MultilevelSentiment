â€¢ Cancer of mouth or throat Let us know about each issue in detail:
1. Bad breath - Usually caused due to poor dental hygiene, bad breath can happen due to the presence of bacteria in the mouth. These bacteria produce a bad odour of gases and can also cause inflammation of the mouth and tongue.
3. Bleeding in gums - Sometimes the gums could start bleeding during brushing or flossing, and may turn red, sore and painful too. If untreated, this condition could result in periodontal disease which could lead to decaying of tooth and the eventual loss of it!
4. Lip- and tongue-related problems - Sore, dry or inflamed lips and tongue are one of the common issues that may happen due to heat, bad diet, low immune system, etc.
5. Dryness in mouth - The mouth tends to dry due to less water intake, less saliva production, consumption of heat-producing food, medicines, etc.
6. Cancer of mouth or throat - Cancer of the throat is one of the most serious issues, and it can grow and spread real fast. Mouth cancer could happen to any part of the mouth, namely lips, cheeks, tongue, palates, sinuses, etc. How Whole Grains Help In Managing Good Oral Health?
While we have listed the most common oral health-related concerns, we must specifically mention the findings of a study conducted by WHO, on the kind of positive effects produced by whole grain carbohydrates on an individual's oral health. This study was published in the Journal of Dental Research.
Although it didn't directly associate the amount of starch consumed to the tooth decay, it did conclude that the processed forms of starch in more quantities assuredly give rise to the risk of cavities.

A further research in the same line claims a lower risk of oral cancer by the consumption of whole grain starch, along with protection against gum-related diseases. Some of the best possible whole grains that you could add to your regular diet are:
