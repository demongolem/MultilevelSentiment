/ No Comments How to Select an E-2 Visa Immigration Lawyer
Unfortunately, many people hire an E-2 Visa Immigration Lawyer only to have their visas denied. While to date our law firm has never failed to prepare an E-2 Visa application case, we have been hired many times to "fix" a large number of flawed applications assembled by inefficient lawyers that have been poorly filed and, consequently, denied.
If you are looking to come to the United States under an E-2 Visa , then you should be extremely careful when selecting the right E-2 Visa Immigration Lawyer. The easiest way to make sure you end up choosing a skilled and experienced lawyer who can successfully present your case is asking yourself the following questions:
How Many E-2 Visa Applications Does your Lawyer File?
As with many visas, practical experience is crucial when submitting E-2 Visa applications. Some lawyers focus on multiple areas of law while others focus narrowly on business and immigration law. We highly recommend you to ask your lawyers how many E-2 Visa clients they work with each year.
Jurado & Farshchian has an experienced E-2 Visa team that assists new E-2 Visa applicants almost every single week of the year. Given the number of E-2 Visa cases our firm has worked on and our record of success, we can assure you that we are among the best options for you.
Has your Lawyer Ever had an E-2 Visa Denied?
You must ask how many cases your lawyer (or law firm) has had denied in their entire career.
As of the day on which this article is being written, no E-2 Visa application filed by our firm or any of the members of our team has ever been denied. Very few law firms in Miami have a similar record of success.
What is your Lawyer's Educational and Professional History?
All lawyers are different; for that reason, you must be diligent and research your lawyers' educational and professional background. What schools did they graduate from? Did they graduate at all or do they just claim to? Which law firm did they train with? Also, you must make sure that your lawyers have not been subject to client complaints.
Is your Lawyer Qualified to Draft a Solid Business Plan?
A solid business plan is a key element towards ensuring the success of an E-2 Visa application and it must be drafted so that it complies with the requirements of the immigration statutes and regulations of the United States. A business plan is an opportunity that you get to tell the U.S. government about your business and how you project the U.S. economy will benefit from its operations.
Failure to draft a proper business plan that meets the E-2 requirements is a common factor in many E-2 Visa denials.
Jurado & Farshchian has a team of expert Immigration Attorneys that have drafted many business plans to date and will surely prepare one for your business based on your unique goals and needs.
Is your Lawyer a Member of the American Immigration Lawyers' Association?
The American Immigration Lawyers' Association (AILA) is the professional association of which most immigration lawyers are members. An easy way to ensure that your lawyers are honest, devoted professionals is to make sure you hire AILA members.
Does your Lawyer or Law Firm Have Experience with E-2 Applicants from your Country?
A highly important question that you must ask is whether your lawyer has any record of success working with other E-2 candidates from your country.
Jurado & Farshchian has a long list of satisfied clients from several countries. When it comes to dealing with U.S. consulates around the world, we have all the skill, knowledge, and experience it takes to handle each E-2 Visa case in accordance with the requirements of each and every treaty country on the list.
