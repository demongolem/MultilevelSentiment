It will be an opportunity for the public to learn about emerging equine blockchain technology, and for industry experts to learn more about the current and future applications of Pegasus Coin. Currently, accessing crucial data on horses, especially a horse's pedigree, is a challenging task. Traders rely on an outdated paper system and expensive DNA tests to accurately assess an animal's genetic background. The horse blockchain platform will bolster transparency, promote an even playing field, increase trust and eliminate fraud, paving the way for previously implausible industries such as horse-trading arbitrage. The event will be a compelling opportunity for Pegasus Coin to not only promote its various benefits and implementations, but to also network with tech industry leaders and discuss next generation blockchain innovation.
