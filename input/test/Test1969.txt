cAMP and cAMP Inhibited cGMP 3',5' Cyclic Phosphodiesterase 10A Phosphodiesterase 10A1 or Phosphodiesterase 10A7 or PDE10A or EC 3.1.4.17 or EC 3.1.4.35 cAMP and cAMPinhibited cGMP 3',5'cyclic phosphodiesterase 10A is an enzyme which plays a critical role in regulating cAMP and cGMP levels in the striatum. Many cellular responses are regulated by second messengers like cAMP and cGMP.
PDE10A eliminate cAMP and cGMPmediated intracellular signaling by hydrolyzing the cyclic nucleotide to the corresponding nucleoside 5prime monophosphate. The molecules developed by companies in Preclinical stages are 9 respectively. Similarly, the universities portfolio in Preclinical stages comprises 1 molecules, respectively. Report covers products from therapy areas Central Nervous System and Oncology which include indications Schizophrenia , Huntington Disease, Lung Cancer, Psychosis, Cognitive Disorders and Psychiatric Disorders.
