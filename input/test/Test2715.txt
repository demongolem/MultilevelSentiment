Principal / Senior Software Developer â€“ Malaria Salary in the region of Â£47,812 â€“ Â£57,853 (Principal Software Developer) or Â£40,850 â€“ Â£49,428 ( Senior Software Developer) plus excellent benefits Fixed term for 2 years with possibility of extension (dependent on external funding)
The role purpose is to support the architecture design and the creation of an informatics system for genomic surveillance of malaria in endemic countries. The post-holder will work with the leads of a newly funded project â€“ Global Health Research Group on genomic surveillance of malaria in West Africa funded by NIHR â€“ to develop software products that support the translation of genomic data into actionable knowledge for malaria control and elimination.
Malaria is a major cause of childhood mortality and socio-economic disruption; control efforts have been ramped up significantly in the last 15 years and this has made a significant impact. However, there is a serious risk that these gains could be reversed in the foreseeable future, because Plasmodium parasites (that cause malaria) and Anopheles mosquitoes (that transmit the parasites from one person to another) are becoming increasingly resistant to malaria control interventions. The overall goal of this project is to establish local capacity in several malaria endemic countries for monitoring drug and insecticide resistance and to develop analytical outputs that will be of practical value to National Malaria Control Programmes (NMCPs) in planning effective interventions. This is an exciting time to join our team as we start a new paradigm where genomic surveillance is integrated into malaria control and elimination decision making.
Genomic surveillance is one of the most rapidly growing and exciting areas of 'Big Data', where the data generated by a local sequencing machine are amplified in information content and practical value if it is part of a global data sharing network. This raises crucial questions such as: how do we develop informatics systems that can work both in resource limited settings and on cloud platforms? How locally-generated data can be integrated with, and augmented by, central resources? What informatics technology can we use to communicate analytical results in an impactful way?
In this context, you will be pivotal in the design, implementation, and deployment of software solutions that: â€¢ provides a scalable data environment for the collection, storage, and integration of data from local and remote resources; â€¢ orchestrates the execution of bioinformatics analysis pipelines, both on local systems as well as on cloud-based environments; â€¢ allows users to interactively visualise the key findings through creative user interface technologies.
Together with the MRC Centre for Genomics and Global Health at Oxford University, the Kwiatkowski group serves as the resource centre for MalariaGEN, a data-sharing network of malaria researchers in more than 40 malaria-endemic countries ( www.malariagen.net ). Over the past 12 years, MalariaGEN has established an international reputation for generating large open access datasets. These data have become the benchmark for Plasmodium and Anopheles population genomics; for promoting equitable data sharing between researchers in rich and poor countries; and for research capacity building in malaria endemic countries. Providing equal opportunities and valuing diversity are intrinsically part of our core values. You will also be member of a software team that is well-known for having top-level expertise in scientific computing and long-standing dedication to open source projects, and participate in high quality and high impact projects themselves. **please note: discussions will take place during the interview process as to which role profile you are being considered for.
