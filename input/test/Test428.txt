Marketing de afiliados Looking for Commision based salesperson for martial art courses.
I am looking for an online marketing Salesperson, based on commission pay. We are launching a new style instructor training course in September and are offering $300 USD commission for every place sold and lead (which becomes a successful booking) gained through your website or whichever medium you use for marketing. For courses / bookings, generally, we can offer 13% commission â€“ which can amount to quite a lot since some people will book for, say, 6 months at a cost of over $8,000 USD (13% commission = $1,040). Please get in contact if this sounds interesting to you and we will send you more details about our company, ethos and the course in question. We'd be interested to know roughly how many sales you believe you could total for this course
