11:37 Blow for Toronto despite win
Toronto coach Paul Rowley admits the loss of prolific tryscorer Liam Kay took the gloss off the Wolfpack's 14-0 win over Halifax in their opening Super 8s fixture.
The Ireland international, who has scored 48 league tries since joining the Wolfpack from Leigh two years ago, was taken off after 23 minutes with an ankle injury and, although he has yet to determine the extent, Rowley does not expect him to play again this year.
Toronto had earlier lost their other regular winger, Matty Russell, with concussion, which forced Rowley to play second row forwards Andrew Dixon and Cory Paterson in the threequarter line for most of the game.
"It was a blow losing two wingers and they are not any two wingers, they are probably our most consistent performers," Rowley said. "It really affected our ruck speed and our cutting edge as well.
"I'm really disappointed for Liam, it looks like it could be season over, but Matty will come back strong."
Toronto finished the Championship season eight points clear of their rivals but Rowley admits they were pushed all the way by their part-time hosts.
Hooker Andy Ackers scored the only try of the first half and they had to wait until Dixon went over for their second four minutes from the end to clinch a hard-fought win.
"To get two points on the board was really important but we really had to work hard for it," Rowley added. "It's testament to their character.
"We saw two committed sides and it was a pretty brutal battle which probably could have gone either way.
"I thought structurally in defence we were good, but some of our detail was off. To get a zero is a massive sign of our commitment as a group to dig in. There were some really honest performances."

Toronto's next test is a home game against Hull KR, one of four Super League opponents lying in wait.
"It's a quick turnaround against arguably one of the two best teams in the eights," Rowley said. "It's another challenge but it's at home.
"The middle eights is about how quickly you can move on. Each game is a cup final.
"It's a tough competition. I think London showed us all the way, beating Widnes. That grabbed everyone's imagination. All four Championship clubs have put best foot forward."
Halifax coach Richard Marshall was proud of the efforts of his part-time players.
"There wasn't a lot between the two teams," Marshall said. "We made it really difficult for them.
"Execution let us down today. We had plenty of opportunities, we had good, strong field position at key times in the game but we came up a bit short. I thought we were a bit edgy and a bit nervous." 10:55 Former FC centre Lyne signs new deal at Wakefield
Reece Lyne has signed a new four-and-half year deal at Wakefield Trinity, the Betfred Super League club have announced.
The 25-year-old arrived at Belle Vue from Hull FC in 2012 and has made 128 appearances and scored 44 tries for Trinity.
Lyne, who was named in the England Knights squad in July, told Wakefield's website: "The club approached me a few months back to talk about a contract extension and I'm really enjoying my time here so it was a no-brainer.
"It will be a real honour to represent the club for 10 years and to get a testimonial at the end of it will be really rewarding."
Trinity head coach Chris Chester added: "It is great news for Reece and the club, he has been fantastic for us this year. He is happy here and very settled at the club and I look forward to working with him for the next three or four years." FORMER FC CENTRE: Wakefield's Reece Lyne.

Hull FC fans can meet Jake Connor, Joe Westerman and Josh Griffin at their Savile Street retail store from 2.30pm tomorrow.
The West Yorkshire-based trio will be heading to the city centre retail store to sign autographs and pose for photos with Black and Whites supporters tomorrow, whilst fans can get a bargain at the same time.
The club's end of line sale has seen 2018 ISC training wear fly of the shelves in the last week, with some products selling out completely. As prices start from as little as just Â£10, fans won't want to miss it.
All of these great offers and more are available from FC's Savile Street retail store, whilst it's an opportunity for supporters to get some memorabilia signed by three Hull players. KEY EVENT Nzoungou linked with FC
League Express are reporting that Hull FC are eyeing a move for Salford prop Levy Nzoungou.
The 20-year-old, who has played just three times for the Red Devils in 2018 all from the bench, is said to be in the eyes of FC boss Lee Radford according to the paper.
Stints on loan with Oldham, Whitehaven and Swinton have failed to see the Congo native break through and it is thought that pastures new would be best for the ex-St Helens, Melbourne Storm and Toulouse youngster.

Sika Manu says Hull FC must stay strong as a group and fight hard together to overcome a current five-match losing streak in the Super League.
The Black and Whites suffered their latest loss at home to Wakefield Trinity on Friday as the visitors amassed 22 points without reply in the final stages to prevail 31-13. Sika Manu congratulates Scott Taylor following his try against Wakefield Trinity
Whilst it was a far cry from the 72-10 hammering at Wakefield last month, Manu explains the squad were still bitterly disappointed with their showing.
But despite the lack of 'buzz' around camp at the moment, the back rower insists everyone at the club must stick together to arrest the current bad run.
Anyone would be lacking confidence after a few losses. We just need to regroup and come back strong. It's probably one of the hardest things to do to put a big performance on after a few losses.
It's been a tough few weeks and there isn't really a buzz around the club but it's really important we stay strong as a group. Gareth Westmorland Sheens: The heat is on
Hull KR are under pressure 'big-time' to turn around their Qualifiers fortunes.
That's the view of coach Tim Sheens, who says there is no hiding place for the Robins in their fight for Super League survival. Hull KR v Salford City Reds: Will Oakes
A 28-10 home loss to Salford Red Devils was damaging in KR's middle 8s campaign and they must travel to Championship runaways Toronto Wolfpack this weekend.
Whilst reiterating that it's not panic stations just yet, Sheens admits KR have it all to do in Canada on Saturday evening.
We're on our toes now, having lost that game to Salford. It goes without saying how important it is. You lose your first game of seven, then if you're not careful you have to go to Leeds all of a sudden and you're in trouble. It's a game where we have to keep our heads.
There's no panic, we're disappointed that we've lost the first game, but it's not the end of the world. The way we played at home was very disappointing.
We didn't nail the attack, our kicking game was poor, our last-play options were rushed and the pressure is back on us big time. Gareth Westmorland
