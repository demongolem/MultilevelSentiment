Educators report low confidence in ed-tech research By Laura Ascione, Managing Editor, Content Services, @eSN_Laura August 17th, 2018 A new survey reveals that vendor research is widely read, but most educators feel they can't depend on it
Although many educators rely on vendor-supplied reports for information on education technology tools, most educators have doubts about vendors' ability to perform reliable research, according to a new survey.
Ninety-one percent of educators in the Education Research Perspectives Survey say they rely heavily on general web searches, and almost half of those surveyed say they rely on vendor reports, for information on education technology tools.
The survey of tech-savvy teachers and administrators was conducted by ISTE and the Jefferson Education Exchange (JEX) and queried more than 1,100 teachers, district staff, school administrators, and technology leaders from all 50 states.
Vendors and media outlets are some of the most frequent sources of ed-tech information, along with general web searches. However, only 24 percent of surveyed educators say they believe ed-tech vendors are well-equipped to conduct reliable ed-tech researchâ€“and just 10 percent believe the same for media organizations.
Educators' low confidence points to a clear need for stronger research
