Solving problems with AVD and KVM on Linux Aug 16, 2018
I installed Android SDK and Android Studio on my new ThinkPad T470s with Ubuntu Linux 18.04.1 LTS. As usual, I wanted to create a new Android phone emulator called AVD (Android Virtual Device). I was able to create a new device, but unfortunately I encoutered problems. After opening AVD window, I saw the error messageâ€¦ /dev/kvm is not found
KVM (Kernel-based Virtual Machine) is a full virtualization solution for Linux on x86 hardware containing virtualization extensions (Intel VT or AMD-V). In order to enable KVM, I needed to restart the computer and enter the BIOS by pressing F1 key before the system boot. Next, I entered Security tab and enabled Intel Virtualization Technology and Intel VT-d Feature . Now, I could press F10 to save, exit nad restart the computer. Unfortunately, that wasn't the end of the story. I saw another error messageâ€¦ /dev/kvm device permission denied
Luckily, I found answer to this issue on StackOverflow . I just needed to install qemu-kvm and add my user to the kvm group.
