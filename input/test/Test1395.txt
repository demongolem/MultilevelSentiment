Debbie's Dream Foundation seeks as its ultimate goal to make the cure for stomach cancer a reality.<br />DDF was founded in 2009 by<br />Debbie Zelman<br />after she was diagnosed with stage IV incurable gastric cancer in 2008 and given only weeks to live. Debbie is considered a pioneer by many for bringing awareness to the plight of stomach cancer patients worldwide and the lack of federal funding for stomach cancer research. She did all of this while receiving hundreds of rounds of chemo in addition to daily oral treatments. Debbie passed away on<br />December 23, 2017<br />, at the age of 50, almost a decade later. As a result of her leadership, DDF now has a Scientific and Medical Advisory Board of world-renowned doctors in addition to chapters throughout<br />the United States<br /
