Subscribe Log In AP Moller-Maersk reveals listing plan for Maersk Drilling Listing in Copenhagen planned for next year as strategy to change conglomerate into the FedEx of container logistics takes another step.
AP Moller-Maersk has revealed plans for an independent listing for Maersk Drilling, which will become the third of four energy businesses to be divested. AP Moller-Maersk sounds profit alarm Skou setting up AP Moller as FedEx of box logistics
The float, set for next year, will take the former conglomerate's cash proceeds from the breakup of its energy business beyond $5bn with a solution for Maersk Supply Service still to be finalized.
Banks have stepped up with $1.5bn in fresh finance to support the separation.
Chief executive Soren Skou says the new funds mean Maersk Drilling will not need to raise capital as part of the listing.
It will start trading as one of the best capitalized companies in the peer group and will have a number of strategic options available in the future.
Jim Hagemann Snabe, chairman of AP Moller, said: "The Maersk Drilling team has done a remarkable job operating the business at a time of high uncertainty and is well positioned to become a successful company on Nasdaq Copenhagen.
"The announcement of the intention to list Maersk Drilling completes the decision process on the structural solutions for the major oil and oil related businesses. Yet another important step in delivering on the strategy."
The spin-off was announced alongside the co mpany's second quarter results, which measured up well with forecasts but were branded unsatisfactory by the group.
Analysts at Clarksons Platou Securities said the solution for Maersk Drilling was "adequate and positive".
Nicolay Dyvik of DNB Markets says price expectations and the size of Maersk Drilling are the reasons why M&A has not happened. AP Moller says Maersk Drilling has a book value of $4.3bn.
"Based on our fair asset value of the rigs in Maersk at $4.35bn, and as most listed drillers are already highly leveraged we believe a potential M&A deal would have been primarily equity, and $4.35bn in equity would have been hard for most listed drillers to finance," Dyvik said.
The group announced in 2016 it was set to exit the energy business as part of a drive to become a container and logistics specialist.
Skou is the architect of the strategy, which he believes will make AP Moller the FedEx of container logistics.
Maersk Oil was the first division to split off after being sold to Total in a cash and shares deal.
The Danish firm has now sold Total stock worth $1.2bn and retains a further $4.7bn.
Maersk Tankers was taken private by the group's controlling shareholders, leaving Maersk Supply as the only energy division left.
"For Maersk Supply Service, the pursuit of a solution will continue. However due to challenging markets, the timing for defining a solution is difficult to predict," AP Moller said.
Skou says there is presently no obvious solution for how to split out Maersk Supply Service given the difficult market in which it operates.
He explains the plan to divest that business must create value, create a viable company and be good for the staff. Subscribe to read this story.
