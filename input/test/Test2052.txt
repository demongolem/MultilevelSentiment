Accusations, such as those Donald Trump made against Mexicans, are the politics of Satan. They are based in fear, not fact. Adam Ericksen calls on us to follow the politics of God and "love the alien as yourself."
In the biblical book of Job, Satan is the Accuser. Satan roams throughout the world as a prosecutor looking to make accusations against people. But Satan doesn't care if people are good or bad. As we see with Job, all Satan cares about is making accusations.
In other words, truth doesn't matter. All that matters is making an accusation that sticks.
Donald Trump made an accusation against Mexican immigrants that has struck a chord with many Republican voters. And that's the point behind the satanic principle of accusation. As RenÃ© Girard claims in his book, I See Satan Fall Like Lightning, "Satan seeks to have others imitate him." Our imitation of Satan primarily comes in the form of accusations against our fellow human beings. That accusation is usually based on fear, a contagious emotion that is easily manipulated by the satanic principle of accusation.
But the fear is baseless because it isn't grounded in truth. That's especially true in the case of immigration. Study after study shows that immigrants, whether legal or illegal, are less likely to be involved in violent crimes than the rest of the population.
In her study, Bianca Bersani, professor of Sociology at the University of Massachusetts, states, "Foreign born individuals exhibit remarkably low levels of involvement in crime across their life course."
Jorg Spenkuch of Northwestern University finds that, "There is essentially no correlation between immigrants and violence crime."
The Public Policy Institute of California reveals that, "Immigrants are underrepresented in California prisons compared to their representation in the overall population. In fact, U.S.-born adult men are incarcerated at a rate over two-and-a-half times greater than that of foreign-born men."
Donald Trump's accusations against Mexican immigrants is a clear example of the politics of Satan. Satanic politics orders the world through accusation, exclusion, andscapegoating. While native born Americans actually have a higher rate of violent criminal activity, that fact doesn't matter to the politics of Satan. What matters is making an accusation that sticks
