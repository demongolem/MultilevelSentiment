Why are CFO's relying on Document Management Automation? Brought to you by PaperLess Europe Ltd. 17th Aug 2018
Some businesses today are still storing paper stashes in an old-fashioned way while other companies use the conventional Scan to Archive methodology for archiving. PaperLess is designed to utilise the best features of Capture>Process>Archive to ensure a quicker and higher ROI for organisations.
That is the reason why an increasing number of CFO's is relying on document management automation since capturing information at the start of a business process allows organisations to manage critical information while reducing manual labour costs such as data entry, sorting, filing, storage and shipping. Capture technology also helps improve the efficiency of core business functions and enhances data quality throughout the organisation.
PaperLess is efficient document management software for your business. The PaperLess comprehensive user rights control protects your data and documentation. Both of your accounting and business documents can be archived in the PaperLess Accounting Archive and Other Documents Archive separately, providing further security for your accounting records. Each user has access to one or more folders or companies within PaperLess with different levels of user rights granted for each folder or company.
The PaperLess powerful search function enables businesses to quickly find any document in the PaperLess archives with the least amount of data required. Multiple search fields make it easy to locate the transaction or document your business needs. Find out more about PaperLess Document Management for Sage 50 and Sage 200

WHAT OUR CLIENTS SAY ABOUT PAPERLESS
"PaperLess is a great system to use as it is a lot faster than approving the pile of paper"
Nicholas Reyes-Ramirez, Finance Assistant
"â€¦the time spent prior to installing PaperLess on processing invoices was lengthy with manually inputting the supplier, description, nominal code and values for each invoice. Invoice recognition does all this for you at a click of a button."
