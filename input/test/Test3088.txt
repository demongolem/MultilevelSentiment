Team Systems and Precision Cancer Medicine
Vacancy Type Full time
Type of Contract Fixed Term
Length of Contract 1 year
Hours per Week 35
Salary Range Â£30,715 â€“ Â£41,550
The Institute of Cancer Research, London, is one of the world's most influential cancer research institutes, with an outstanding record of achievement dating back more than 100 years. We provided the first convincing evidence that DNA damage is the basic cause of cancer, laying the foundation for the now universally accepted idea that cancer is a genetic disease. Today, The Institute of Cancer Research ( ICR ) leads the world at isolating cancer-related genes and discovering new targeted drugs for personalised cancer treatment.
Under the leadership of our Chief Executive, Professor Paul Workman FRS , the ICR is ranked as the UK's leading academic research centre. Together with our partner The Royal Marsden, we are rated in the top four cancer centres globally.
The ICR is committed to attracting, developing and retaining the best minds in the world to join us in our mission â€“ to make the discoveries that defeat cancer.
Vacancy Description
We seek a motivated, experienced and independent Postdoctoral Training Fellow with extensive next generation sequencing data analysis skills to play a key role in facilitating the research of the Systems and Precision Cancer Medicine Team (Team Leader Anguraj Sadanandam). Our interdisciplinary lab focuses on personalized medicine and companion diagnostics using cancer subtypes and evolution by integrating multi-omics (molecular and metabolism) and phenomics (phenotypes) data. We perform this by integrating computational biology skills (in-house developed cutting-edge computational and statistical tools) with wet-lab science by cross-comparing and integrating high-throughput data (including whole tumour and single cell omics data) between patients and in vivo and in vitro models. To this end, we have classified different tumor types including breast cancer cell lines, and pancreatic and colorectal tumours and cell lines into distinct molecular and/or drug response subtypes ( PNAS 2012, Nature Medicine 2011, 2013 and 2015, and Cancer Discovery 2015). We also develop and publish next generation statistical tools for genome-phenome analysis and other purposes (Nyamundanda et al., Scientific Reports 2017, bioRxiv 2017; Ragulan et al., bioRxiv 2017; Eason et al., BMC Bioinformatics 2018). We also make our tools available through github ( https://github.com/syspremed ).

The successful candidate will help us in using novel pipelines of computational methods to integrate and analyze next generation sequencing and other profile data from 400+ patient samples and clinical information. This also includes high-throughput cell lines based drug response data. The candidate will assist the entire lab to manage the large-scale data and local systems administration. Our lab has access to the ICR's high performance computing facility for data processing. They will also be engaged in collaborative research projects within the lab and beyond, potentially resulting in high profile publications. They will be encouraged to develop their own research interests in areas related to the Centre's activities.
Applicants should possess a Ph.D. (or equivalent) in bioinformatics, computational biology, genomic sciences, statistics, mathematics, physics, life sciences or other related fields with extensive experience in bioinformatics and next generation omics data analysis. Experience in analyzing massively parallel sequencing data in cancer is essential as well as strong analytical skills. Excellent organisational, writing and communication skills are also required. Knowledge in molecular biology and related life sciences field is essential.
This is an excellent opportunity for an independent and motivated individual to work in an exciting and highly collaborative environment. The position is offered on a fixed-term contract of 1 year with a starting salary within the range of Â£30,715 â€“ Â£41,550 per annum inclusive based upon relevance of skills and experience.
