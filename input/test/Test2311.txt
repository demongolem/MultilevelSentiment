Thousands to take part in World Pipe Band Championships More than 200 bands from 13 countries are taking part in this year's World Pipe Band Championships.
The event, know as "the worlds", returns to Glasgow on Friday and Saturday.
In total, around 8,000 pipers and drummers in 214 bands are competing for the ultimate prize in the two-day competition on Glasgow Green.
More than a quarter of the competitors are coming from overseas with New Zealand, Denmark, Canada, Oman and Zimbabwe among the nations represented, organisers said.
Ian Embelton, chief executive of the Royal Scottish Pipe Band Association, said: "Year after year, pipe bands across the world head to Glasgow and the World Pipe Band Championships to compete and test themselves against their peers.
"The competition this year is the fiercest it has ever been with the standards across each grade higher than ever.
"We are looking forward to another memorable occasion knowing that whoever comes out on top on Saturday night will deserve to be world champions."
Glasgow first staged the event in 1948 and has been the host city every year since 1986.
The chieftain of the 2018 event is Glasgow's Lord Provost, Eva Bolander, who first visited the city as a piper in a band.
She said: "Glasgow and the World Pipe Band Championships are inextricably linked and we love welcoming pipers and drummers from all over the world to compete.
"I know what it's like to put months of work into rehearsing as part of a band to head into the arena to be judged on one single performance.
"The musical ability on display at Glasgow Green this weekend, coupled with the friendly rivalry brings an atmosphere and experience that simply can't be matched.
