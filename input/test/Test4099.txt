The deadline for PPI complaints is August 29, 2019. As many as 64 million PPI policies have been sold in the UK, mostly in the 20 years after 1990 â€“ but some stretching as far back as the 1970s.
Some Â£31.5 billion has already been paid back between January 2011 and May 2018 to customers who complained about the way they were sold PPI. If you had a PPI policy you weren't happy about you can complain yourself â€“ for free â€“ and it might be easier than you think.

What is PPI? PPI or payment protection insurance was designed to cover repayments if you found you were unable to make them yourself for particular reasons â€“ perhaps due to being made redundant, having an accident or being ill.
What financial products might I have had that PPI has been added to? PPI was tacked onto products such as personal and business loans, credit cards, store cards, mortgages, catalogue credit and other types of credit, such as car finance and hire purchase agreements for household items.
So why did PPI become controversial? PPI was found to have often been mis-sold, to people who didn't need it because it was unsuitable, felt under pressure to sign up, or in some cases didn't even realise they had a PPI policy because it was simply added without them asking.

Are there other circumstances in which I could make a PPI claim? Yes â€“ importantly, you may now find you're entitled to money back just for having the policy â€“ even if you don't think it was mis-sold to you.
There's a new reason you can complain â€“ and it's if the bank or other provider earned a high level of commission from the sale of PPI but you weren't told when you bought it. Providers were often paid commission by the insurer, as a reward for the sale of PPI. The money for this commission would come out of the payments you made for the policy. A high level of commission typically means it was more than half of what you paid for your PPI policy.
These rules mean it's also possible to complain even if you've had a previous complaint about the mis-selling of PPI rejected. You don't need to know or explain how much commission was paid for your PPI policy. If you don't know the details, you can still complain.
