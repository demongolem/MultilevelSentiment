Denver elementary and middle school students continued a recent streak of high academic growth this year on state literacy and math tests, results released Thursday show. That growth inched the district's scores even closer to statewide averages, turning what was once a wide chasm into a narrow gap of 2 percentage points in math and 3 in literacy.
Still, fewer than half of Denver students in grades three through eight met state expectations in literacy, and only about a third met them in math.

Denver's high schoolers lagged in academic growth, especially ninth-graders who took the PSAT for the first time. Their test scores were lower than statewide averages.
"We are absolutely concerned about that," Superintendent Tom Boasberg said Thursday of the ninth-grade scores, "and that is data we need to dig in on and understand."
Students across Colorado took standardized literacy and math tests this past spring. Third- through eighth-graders took the Colorado Measures of Academic Success, or CMAS, tests, which are also known as the PARCC tests. High school students took college entrance exams: Ninth- and 10th-graders took the PSAT, a preparatory test, and 11th-graders took the SAT.
On CMAS, 42 percent of Denver students in grades three through eight met or exceeded state expectations in literacy. Statewide, 45 percent of students did . In math, 32 percent of Denver students met expectations, compared with 34 percent statewide.
While Denver's overall performance improved in both subjects, third-grade literacy scores were flat. That's noteworthy because the district has invested heavily in early literacy training for teachers and has seen progress on tests taken by students in kindergarten through third grade. That wasn't reflected on the third-grade CMAS test, though Boasberg said he's hopeful it will be as more students meant to benefit from the training take that test. Education news. In your inbox.

On the PSAT tests, Denver ninth-graders earned a mean score of 860, which was below the statewide mean score of 902. The mean PSAT score for Denver 10th-graders was 912, compared with the statewide mean score of 944. And on the SAT, Denver 11th-graders had a mean score of 975. Statewide, the mean score for 11th-graders was 1014.
White students in Denver continued to score higher , and make more academic progress year to year, than black and Hispanic students. The same was true for students from high- and middle-income families compared with students from low-income families.
For example, 69 percent of Denver students from high- and middle-income families met expectations on the CMAS literacy tests, compared with just 27 percent of students from low-income families â€“ which equates to a 42 percentage-point gap. That especially matters in Denver because two-thirds of the district's 92,600 students are from low-income families.
Boasberg acknowledged those gaps, and said it is the district's core mission to close them. But he also pointed out that Denver's students of color and those from low-income families show more academic growth than their peers statewide. That means they're making faster progress and are more likely to reach or surpass grade-level in reading, writing, and math.
Denver Public Schools pays a lot of attention to annual academic growth, as measured by a state calculation known as a "median growth percentile."
The calculation assigns students a score from 1 to 99 that reflects how much they improved compared with other students with similar score histories. A score of 99 means a student did better on the test than 99 percent of students who scored similarly to him the year before.
Students who score above 50 are considered to have made more than a year's worth of academic progress in a year's time, whereas students who score below 50 are considered to have made less than a year's worth of progress.
The state also calculates overall growth scores for districts and schools. Denver Public Schools earned a growth score of 55 on the CMAS literacy tests and 54 on the CMAS math tests. Combined, those scores were the highest among Colorado's 12 largest districts.
Other bright spots in the district's data: Denver's students learning English as a second language â€“ who make up more than a third of the population â€“ continued to outpace statewide averages in achievement. For example, 29 percent of Denver's English language learners met expectations in literacy, while only 22 percent statewide did, according to the district.
Denver eighth-graders also surpassed statewide averages in literacy for the first time this year: 45 percent met or exceeded expectations, as opposed to 44 percent statewide. That increase is reflected in the high growth scores for Denver eighth-graders: 52 in math and 57 in literacy.
Those contrast sharply with the ninth-grade growth scores: 47 in math and an especially low 37 in literacy. That same group of students had higher growth scores last year, Boasberg said; why their progress dropped so precipitously is part of what district officials hope to figure out
