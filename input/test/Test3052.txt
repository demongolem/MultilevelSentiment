Commenting on the partnership, Princess Adesola Ogunleye, president of ANMFIN, said, "The partnership will enable all of our MFIs to move to Oradian's cloud-based solution, helping our members to save time and money through more efficient, digitised processes - no more manual input of data."
Launching ANMFIN Cloud Express expands the range of solutions that Oradian offers in Nigeria. As stated by Antonio Separovic, CEO of Oradian, "Nigeria was Oradian's first market when we started Oradian six years ago and we remain committed to solving the financial inclusion challenge here. This partnership is a long-term partnership that is an important step towards this goal."
The partnership will enable ANMFIN to promote access to financial services for Nigerian clients on a larger scale by using ANMFIN Cloud Express, a core banking system specially built for ANMFIN and its microfinance institution (MFI) members. ANMFIN Cloud Express, powered by Instafin, is a cloud-based toolset tailored to enable smaller Nigerian microfinance institutions (MFIs) to benefit from a cloud-based solution.
Onyeka Adibeli, programme director of Oradian for Africa, noted, "ANMFIN Cloud Express enhances MFIs' ability to manage all operations including client relationships, transactions, portfolio management and reporting in the same way that large banks do - but at a fraction of the cost. We are removing the barriers that prevent MFIs from using the right technology to serve their clients and to strengthen their operations."
With a cost and a system tailored for the needs of smaller MFIs, Oradian's partnership with ANMFIN enables more financial institutions to take advantage of technology to become more efficient, grow and reach more unbanked individuals in rural communities
