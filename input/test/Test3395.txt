SMi's Exclusive Interview with Mark Albrecht just released SMi Group August 17, 2018
SMi Reports: An exclusive interview with Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA) acting Chief Mark Albrecht has been released in the run-up to the 3rd annual Superbugs & Superdrugs USA Conference taking place in Iselin, New Jersey on November 12 â€“ 13, 2018.
Mark provided us with some insightful content about his role in the field, his view on challenges within the field and his vision on the future of the development of novel anti-infectives. His presentation will focus on 'Supporting Antibacterial Research and Development', how BARDA partners with industry to stimulate innovation in AMR R&D and how CARB-X is refilling the preclinical AMR product pipeline.
He works closely with product sponsors to advance the development of their antibacterial candidates, towards consideration for regulatory approval for both public health and biodefense indications, coordinating efforts to advance the development of bio-defence medical countermeasures and ensure that Government agency portfolios are properly aligned.
By attending our 3rd annual Superbugs & Superdrugs USA event, not only would you benefit from the knowledge delivered through a range of thought-provoking presentations, by experts at the forefront of the field; but you would also receive the opportunity to interact with and exchange ideas with decision makers from all of the different facets of the industry â€“ from research to commercial providers and regulatory bodies.
â€“SNAPSHOT OF INTERVIEWâ€“
Q. What do you see as the greatest hurdle to developing novel and effective anti-infectives?
A. There are a variety of challenges affecting the antibacterial development industry including optimal pipeline composition to withstand attrition and the development of resistance, and clarity on the development/regulatory path for a single pathogen anti-infective; however, there has been far greater discussion regarding the lower commercial returns antibiotics generate compared to other therapeutic areas such as cancer or heart disease. Given that antibiotic development is financially challenging with an uncertain return on investment (ROI) it is clear that both push mechanisms (CARB-X, GARD-P, NIAID, Wellcome Trust, BARDA, etc.) and pull incentives are necessary. In particular, pull incentives will ensure companies have a predictable ROI for developing these drugs that society requires, but undervalues. Dozens of publications have described a variety of incentive structures, any of which would involve tradeoffs for all parties, including sponsors, non-profit organizations, and payers, therefore, there is work to be done to establish a consensus recommendation for policymakers.
Q. What do you hope to gain from this meeting?
A. I am looking forward to the opportunity to meet all the attendees and speak with them about their products, challenges and the opportunities that CARB-X and BARDA offer.
At this year's two-day conference, delegates will be able to hear from HHS/ASPR/BARDA and many more industry leaders, including Scynexis, Janssen, Octagon Therapeutics, Astellas and more.
