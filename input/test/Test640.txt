LATEST: Fire service unveils mobile app to aid firefighting Aug 17, 2018 By: Abara Bleesing Oluchi -
The Federal Fire Service has introduced Fire Alert System Application (FASAPP), a mobile app, to reduce the response time of firefighters to fire outbreaks in the country.
The Controller-General of the Service, Mr Joseph Anebi, made this known during a workshop and enlightenment programme on 'Enforcement of Fire Alarms and Extinguishing Equipment Regulation' yesterday in Abuja.
Anebi said when fire outbreak occurs, the mobile App has the capability to inform the Fire Service and the owner of the building simultaneously.
"With SmokeCom, an innovative feature of this App, buildings will be registered and fire detectors installed such that when there is fire outbreak, the Fire Service and the owner of the building will be automatically contacted.
"FASAPP also provides the general public with emergency ambulance services and fire educational enlightenment notifications," he said.
He said the new app had helped to regulate the sale of fire extinguishers.
Anebi said FASAPP could be downloaded from all APP stores by simply dialing *737*3*300#.
He said the introduction of FASAPP to the agency had repositioned it to serve Nigerians better
