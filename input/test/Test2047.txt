Adidas kicks off Twitter live-streaming partnership with high school football By John Glenday - 17 August 2018 08:27am Adidas kicks off Twitter live-streaming partnership with high school football
Adidas and Twitter have formed a new collaboration to screen high school football matches on the social platform, the first time that the games will have been live-streamed in this way.
'Friday Night Stripes' will commence from September 7 and run through November 9, during which the eight-game series will make its appearance on the platform as teams from as far afield as Florida and California battle it out for victory.
Kelly Olmstead, VP of brand activation for Adidas said: "From grassroots to the NFL , adidas is ever-present in football culture and being digital first is everything when it comes to connecting with our consumer. We're excited to be the first brand to live stream high school football games on Twitter and revolutionize the way fans can experience the game."
Andrew Barge, head of sports broadcast partnerships at Twitter added: "High school football fans view Twitter as an indispensable tool to follow what's happening -- whether it's the national recruiting stage or their local communities, every Friday night, we see players, teams, coaches, alumni, and fans embrace this passionate culture."
Live-stream matches will be made available internationally via @adidasFballUS and will be accompanied by a timeline of related conversations.
