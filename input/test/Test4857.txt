DENVER , Aug. 17, MJ Freeway has been ranked 1975 on the 37th annual Inc. 5000, the most prestigious ranking of the nation's fastest-growing private companies compiled by Inc magazine. The list provides a unique look at the most successful companies within the American economy's most dynamic segmentâ€”its independent small businesses. Microsoft, Dell, LinkedIn, and many other well-known names gained their first national exposure as honorees on the Inc. 5000.
"MJ Freeway has the best team of people who have achieved growth that puts us in an elite category with four consecutive years on the Inc. 5000 list. Our team's genius zone is finding the best tech solutions for cannabis businesses. And our clients continue to trust us. MJ Freeway has processed more than $10 billion in legal cannabis sales," says Jessica Billingsley , CEO and Co-Founder.

"If your company is on the Inc. 5000, it's unparalleled recognition of your years of hard work and sacrifice," says Inc. editor-in-chief James Ledbetter . "The lines of business may come and go, or come and stay. What doesn't change is the way entrepreneurs create and accelerate the forces that shape our lives."
