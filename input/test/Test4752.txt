As well as the cash boost, Taylor Wimpey North Yorkshire donated a van full of furnishings to Forces Support in Darlington.
"Our Millfields show homes have recently been given a facelift and, as part of this, we auctioned off a lot of furniture, including tables, chairs and lamps, to our staff," said Debbie Whittingham, sales and marketing director for Taylor Wimpey North Yorkshire.
"We wanted to give the money and items to worthy causes to support their commitment to helping others."
Millfields, on McMullen Road in Darlington, currently has a range of two and three-bedroom properties available and recently-renovated show homes for prospective buyers and visitors to view.
"As part of our strong community engagement programme we try to give back to the causes and organisations that offer so much support to so many as often as we can," said Debbie.
"This idea was something a little different and we hope it has gone some way to helping the charities."
