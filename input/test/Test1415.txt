One is they don't want to study history, and secondly, having lived in this country for a very long time, probably all their lives, they don't understand English irony either".<br />He added: "They needed two lessons, which we could perhaps help them with."<br />Writing on<br />, Ms Berger, said: "The video released today of the leader of @UKLabour making inexcusable comments - defended by a party spokesman - makes me as a proud British Jew feel unwelcome in my own party.<br />"I've lived in Britain all my life and I don't need any lessons in history/irony."<br /
