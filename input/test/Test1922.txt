Valve is working on a new set of tools to get Windows-compatible PC games running on Linux operating systems, according to data uncovered in Steam's GUI files .
The changes were noted by Reddit users, who discovered hidden text related to an unannounced Steam Play system.
There are various text excerpts in the code, and many point to the ability for Steam Play to enable Linux gamers to play Windows games.
"Steam Play will automatically install compatibility tools that allow you to play games from your library that were built for other operating systems," states the text.
"You can use Steam Play to test games in your library that have not been verified with a supported compatibility tool."
The upcoming system has the potential to improve gaming on a Steam Machine or other devices with SteamOS installed, too.
Valve has not revealed any information regarding the system.
