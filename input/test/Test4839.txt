SINGAPORE (Nikkei Markets) -- Singapore doubled its overseas shipments of pharmaceuticals and food preparations in July from year-ago levels, lifting exports data well above expectations and underlining the strength of manufacturing activity in the city-state.
However, several economists warned that last month's gains were not sustainable given the continued weakness in shipments of electronics as well as the brewing trade war between the U.S. and China.
Based on data from trade agency Enterprise Singapore, non-oil exports grew 11.8% year on year in July. That was above market consensus for around 7.5% growth and much faster than June's on-year expansion of 0.8%.
The pace was also better than that of some other major technology exporters in the region - South Korea recently reported exports growth of 6.2% in July, while Taiwan posted a 4.7% rise.
Compared to a month ago, non-oil domestic exports rose 4.3% to a seasonally adjusted 15.7 billion Singapore dollars ($11.4 billion), reversing June's on-month fall of 11.1%, Enterprise Singapore said.
Singapore reports non-oil domestic exports as these provide a better gauge of the country's economic activity. This is because prices of refined oil products tend to be volatile while total exports include the billions of dollars of goods produced elsewhere that are shipped through Singapore's container ports, the world's second busiest after Shanghai.
Although the July figures were better than the consensus expectation, electronics exports still lag behind last year's levels, Robert Carnell, ING's Asia-Pacific chief economist and head of research, said in a note to clients.
"An eye-watering 109% year-on-year gain in pharmaceuticals - mainly driven by last year's weakness - played a helping role in this month's outsize recovery," he added.
Exports of drugs, a sector that tends to be volatile due to sharp variations in production cycles, have helped offset the drag from waning demand for electronics in recent months.
According to Enterprise Singapore, electronics exports declined 3.8% in July from a year ago, hurt by slower shipments of integrated circuits, diodes and transistors, and personal computer parts. However, the pace was slower than June's 8.6% fall.
In contrast, shipments of non-electronic products expanded 18.8% on year, following the 4.5% rise in the previous month. Besides pharmaceuticals and food preparations, the primary chemicals segment was the other star performer with growth of 41.3% on year.
Among key export markets, shipments to the U.S., Japan and the European Union increased while sales to China were unchanged compared to a year ago, Enterprise Singapore said. Exports to China shrank by 15.8% on year in June.
Looking ahead, Selena Ling, head of treasury research and strategy at Oversea-Chinese Banking Corp. , said exports growth would likely slow in coming months due to the higher base a year ago and escalating tensions between the U.S. and China.
Since pharmaceuticals output and exports can be rather volatile, "it is unclear how long this current uptick will sustain beyond the immediate few months ahead," she added.
For the whole of this year, OCBC expects non-oil exports growth of 4% to 5%, which is below the first seven months' pace of 6.2%.
Earlier this week, Enterprise Singapore upgraded its exports growth outlook to 2.5% to 3.5% this year as against its earlier estimate of 1% to 3%.
However, gross domestic product growth data for the second quarter, released a few days ago, fell below analysts' forecasts.
According to the Ministry of Trade and Industry, Singapore's economy expanded 3.9% on year during the April-June period. MTI also said full-year growth would likely fall between 2.5% and 3.5%, amid risks posed by U.S. tariffs on imports from major trading partners.
