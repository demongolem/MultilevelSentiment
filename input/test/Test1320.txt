A WORD FROM THE CEO<br />Dear Heliospectra AB (publ) Shareholder,<br />There are many positive developments to share with you as Heliospectra continues to execute according to our plan on multiple fronts, from developing new strategic accounts and partnerships to expanding our longtime technology leadership.<br />Heliospectra's unique approach to maximizing value by integrating hardware, software control and technical services caused global leader ABB to perceive our company as an ideal market and technology partner. In May, we formally joined forces with ABB to address increasing demand for sustainable agricultural products with new food production and infrastructure technologies. The partnership will initially yield new sales opportunities for both companies and will enable us to provide fully integrated solutions to commercial growers around the world. In the longer term, we'll introduce technology collaborations that expand upon Heliospectra's light control and automation platform. In the upcoming periods, I'll have more news to share with you about our electrification and light installation capabilities and other joint projects.<br />The HelioCOREâ„¢ light management software we released earlier this year is receiving an enthusiastic market response. Our system-based approach to lighting design, customized for each climate and facility, provides growers with unprecedented control over crop yields, cycle times and quality as well as energy consumption. HelioCORE is rapidly changing grower attitudes about what a lighting partner can deliver.<br />In furthering our strategy to support the full crop lifecycle in large-scale greenhouses, vertical farms and agtech operations, we introduced a new lightbar platform. Based on our R&amp;D team's decade of work with varied light spectra, the Heliospectra lightbars provide an end-to-end solution from propagation to on-time harvest. This new platform, designed for use in tough commercial environments, is measurably superior to the previous lightbar design it replaced.<br />To maintain our undisputed quality leadership in the market, parallel initiatives has been underway to improve the design and increase the efficiency of our flagship top lighting platform. The next-generation of our top lights, to be released in Q4, will be much brighter than the previous one and it will follow a modular design and lower production cost.<br />These advancements expand Heliospectra's technology leadership both in the most mature horticultural LED lighting market, with high competition from low-cost competitors, and the most high-tech markets, where automated farming is mainstream.<br />Despite the minor market delays experienced while we invested in upgrading our technology platforms and manufacturing capacities, we improved order intake by 64 percent, net sales by 47 percent and operating loss before tax by 12 percent compared to the same period last year.<br />I am very pleased to work with shareholders who support our passion for innovation, sustainability, quality and results. As always, I thank you for your steadfast commitment to the Heliospectra vision.<br />Ali Ahmadian<br /
