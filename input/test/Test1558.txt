And I moderated a presidential debate eight weeks after having my baby," says Campbell Brown, who was a television news journalist before joining Facebook. "I was literally pumping breast milk on the floor in an auditorium 10 minutes before I went on the air."<br />Tech, like news, tends to be male-dominated, but Brown says the atypically high presence of women on Facebook's news teams makes them special.<br />"These are all women who like to work on hard problems, who feel a sense of mission around the work that we're trying to do and understand the importance of it, the impact it has on our society, on our children and how they're going to grow up in this world," she says. "And that connects us in a pretty powerful way."<br />Published:<br /
