Between 2005 and 2007, United Nations peacekeeping troops carried out several raids in CitÃ© Soleil - an economically depressed neighbourhood of Port au Prince, Haiti. Although the raids were targeted at criminal gang leaders, scores of civilians, amongst them children, were killed with many more injured by the actions of the peacekeepers. The UN has never investigated what happened. No one from the UN or other official bodies have visited the people of CitÃ© Soleil to ask them about their experiences.
It Stays With You examines the impacts of the raids on the community in the ten years since they happened. The documtary uniquely combines testimony from victims and survivors with doctrinal legal analysis on the use of deadly force and human rights.
This free screening will be followed by a panel discussion with director of the film Professor SiobhÃ¡n Wills in conversation with Associate Professors David Letts and Jeremy Farrall. Speakers SiobhÃ¡n Wills Â»
