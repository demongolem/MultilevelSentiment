Where else can you run 10K or 5K; raise funds for a vital charity; spend time in an iconic London Royal Park; enjoy fantastic views of a world famous zoo and have the chance to win a free place in the London Landmarks Half Marathon 2019? Regent's Park Run on Saturday 8 September offers all this and more but you must enter before the end of August to qualify for the London Landmarks Half Marathon free entry bonus. British Heart Foundation invites you to sign up for Regent's Park Run and to support vital and pioneering research to help beat heart and circulatory diseases. Anyone registered by 31 August will be automatically entered into a prize draw for a free entry for the flagship London Landmarks Half Marathon; raise Â£150 by the same date and you will double your chance of success in the draw and if you raise Â£500 by 6 October you will receive three entries into the lucky dip. All entries include free training advice, fundraising support, medical cover, chip timing, medal and an exclusive Regent's Park Run technical T-shirt. The well marked and marshalled course is mainly flat on tarmac paths, so ideal for all ages and abilities. Regent's Park is home to the world's oldest scientific zoo: ZSL London Zoo, so look out for glimpses of camels and various other exotic species en route. Standard entry costs Â£20 (Â£10 for under-18s) but this fee merely covers the basic costs of promotion. It's the money raised by big-hearted runners that powers the essential, life-saving research and education that British Heart Foundation is renowned for. Limited pay and display parking is available but public transport may be the better option as Regent's Park has its own tube station. There will be a secure baggage store, cafe and toilet facilities and water at the finish and on the course for 10K runners. So for a day that combines your favourite activity with sightseeing opportunities and raising funds for a charity that is close to all our hearts, go to the Regent's Park Run website to secure your number today
