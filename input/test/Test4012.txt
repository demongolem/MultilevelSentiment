Orbis Research - Friday, August 17, 2018. An IMU is a self-contained system that measures linear acceleration and angular motion/rotational rate using a combination of (typically) three gyroscopes and three accelerometers. IMUs are used as components of navigation and guidance systems to track the position, velocity, and orientation of a vehicle throughout a particular mission. Honeywell, Northrop Grumman and SAFRAN captured the top three revenue share spots in the IMU market in 2017. Honeywell dominated with 32.78 percent revenue share, followed by Northrop Grumman with 19.28 percent revenue share and SAFRAN with 9.12 percent revenue share. In this study, the consumption of Inertial Measurement Unit divided into four geographic regions: In North America, total Inertial Measurement Unit accounted for 38.60%. In the Europe, total Inertial Measurement Unit accounted for 31.00%. The market in China Inertial Measurement Unit accounted for 13.86 %, In Middle East, total Inertial Measurement Unit accounted for 4.27 %, and in other region 12.28 %. Among all regions, North America is estimated to represent the highest share. In terms of applications, the Defense segment was estimated to account for the highest sales volume share of 36.39 % in 2017. Industrial applications are significant today and are expected to be the most growing markets until 2025.
