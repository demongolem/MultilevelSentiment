Katie Rogers<br />Aug. 23, 2018<br />WASHINGTON â€” President Trump blamed the Justice Department on Thursday for the investigations surrounding him, criticized the deal struck with his former lawyer Michael D. Cohen and lashed out at Attorney General Jeff Sessions, who countered with a rare public rebuke of the president.<br />Mr. Trump also praised Paul Manafort, his former campaign manager who was<br />convicted of financial fraud<br />this week, for refusing to cooperate with the Justice Department and said that plea agreements, an essential tool for prosecutors, should maybe be outlawed.<br />â€œItâ€™s called flipping, and it almost ought to be illegal,â€� Mr. Trump said in an interview that aired on Fox News.<br />Asked whether he was considering firing Mr. Sessions, the president only reiterated his longstanding objection to Mr. Sessionsâ€™s recusal from the Russia investigation and his insistence that he would have chosen another person for attorney general had he known someone else would oversee the inquiry. â€œHe took the job and then he said, â€˜Iâ€™m going to recuse myself,â€™â€� Mr. Trump said of Mr. Sessions. â€œI said, â€˜What kind of a man is this?â€™â€�<br />In an implicit but pointed reply, Mr. Sessions warned the president not to intrude on federal law enforcement. â€œWhile I am attorney general, the actions of the Department of Justice will not be improperly influenced by political considerations,â€� he said in a statement issued shortly before he met with Mr. Trump at the White House about criminal justice overhaul.<br />The exchange escalated the public war that Mr. Trump has waged for more than a year on the Justice Department, training most of his fire on the special counsel investigation. Mr. Sessionsâ€™s response, his most forceful public pushback yet on Mr. Trump, showed the treacherous political terrain he is navigating: appointed by a president who has made apparent that he views law enforcement as loyal protectors but overseeing a Justice Department that views independence from political pressure as essential to the rule of law.<br />Their exchange also came on a day of potentially damaging revelations for the president about the special counsel and Cohen inquiries. A longtime friend and the publisher of The National Enquirer, David J. Pecker,<br />was given immunity<br />to detail Mr. Cohenâ€™s crimes and Mr. Trumpâ€™s role, a person familiar with the investigation confirmed. Mr. Trumpâ€™s lawyers also revealed that they warned him against even considering pardons for Mr. Manafort or other former aides, at least for now, opening Mr. Trump to accusations of tampering.<br />Republicans on Capitol Hill stood firm behind Mr. Sessions, who spent two decades as a senator, publicly cautioning Mr. Trump against firing him. They cited a packed calendar and a lack of confirmable replacements for a closely divided Senate where Democrats are watching vigilantly for any moves by the president that could undermine the Russia investigation.<br />â€œWe donâ€™t have time, nor is there a likely candidate who could get confirmed, in my view, under the current circumstances,â€� said Senator John Cornyn of Texas, the chamberâ€™s No. 2 Republican. Senator Susan Collins of Maine, a key Republican swing vote, warned that removing Mr. Sessions because of his recusal from the Russia investigation â€œcertainly would not be a wise move.â€� A spokesman for the majority leader, Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, said he was not aware of any change in the leaderâ€™s support for Mr. Sessions.<br />But there were signs of softening, too, mainly from Senator Charles E. Grassley, Republican of Iowa and the head of the Judiciary Committee. Mr. Grassley has warred with Mr. Sessions over one of his top policy priorities, a<br />comprehensive bipartisan criminal justice overhaul<br />also championed by the presidentâ€™s son-in-law and senior adviser, Jared Kushner. Mr. Grassley has said he believes that Mr. Sessions has led opposition within the administration to the legislative package.<br />During Thursdayâ€™s meeting at the White House, the president held off on backing the proposal at least until after Novemberâ€™s midterm elections, concluding that an endorsement now carried too much political risk, according to a senior White House official who was not authorized to disclose the private discussions and spoke on the condition of anonymity.<br />â€œThe president remains committed to meaningful prison reform and will continue working with the Senate on their proposed additions to the bill,â€� Hogan Gidley, a White House spokesman, said in a statement.<br />Video<br />President Trump made a career of firing people on TV. Now, he is expressing his disappointment with Attorney General Jeff Sessions publicly through tweets, but has not uttered two key words.<br />Published On<br />Credit<br />Image by Doug Mills/The New York Times<br />Mr. Trumpâ€™s decision notably aligned him with Mr. Sessions, at least in the short term, and Mr. Grassley signaled his displeasure with the attorney generalâ€™s interference by suggesting he would be open to confirming a possible replacement for him. â€œIâ€™ve got time for hearings this fall,â€� he told reporters. He had protected Mr. Sessions last year amid rumors of his firing by saying that the Senate would not make room for confirmation hearings for a new attorney general.<br />Senator Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina, also hedged his support for Mr. Sessions, noting that it was obvious Mr. Sessions had lost the presidentâ€™s confidence and that he did not necessarily object to Mr. Trump replacing him under the right circumstances after the midterm elections. Mr. Graham had previously said that Mr. Trump would have â€œholy hell to payâ€� if he fired Mr. Sessions.<br />Mr. Trump, who tends to be far less confrontational with perceived foes in private settings, was cordial with Mr. Sessions at their meeting on criminal justice overhaul. Neither man brought up their barbed exchange, according to two senior administration officials who attended the meeting and spoke on the condition of anonymity to describe private conversations.<br />Mr. Sessions followed the presidentâ€™s lead in the meeting, the officials said. The two agreed on several points made by advisers on prison reform. For example, if the legislation moves forward, both men agreed that they would want to increase the sentencing penalty for drug cases that involve fentanyl. In the past, both have recommended<br />putting some drug dealers to death<br />.<br />After the meeting, Mr. Kushner sped to Capitol Hill to meet with Mr. Grassley, Mr. McConnell and Mr. Cornyn to try to find a path forward for the legislation.<br />Mr. Trump, who had been relatively subdued in the day or so after Mr. Cohenâ€™s and Mr. Manafortâ€™s convictions, had grown enraged by Wednesday night, according to people who spoke to him.<br />The president privately vented to associates that he was furious with Mr. Sessions for failing to protect him in the way he believes Attorney General Eric H. Holder Jr. had protected President Barack Obama.<br />Mr. Trump wanted to rebut the Mr. Sessionsâ€™s statement on Thursday on Twitter, but his advisers stopped him, according to people briefed on the matter, at least into the evening.<br />He also complained during his Fox interview that the<br />campaign finance crimes Mr. Cohen admitted committing<br />at his direction were â€œtiny ones,â€� or â€œnot even crimes.â€�<br />But he appeared to chiefly blame Mr. Sessions for his legal woes. â€œI put in an attorney general that never took control of the Justice Department,â€� Mr. Trump said. â€œJeff Sessions never took control of the Justice Department and itâ€™s a sort of an incredible thing.â€�<br />The presidentâ€™s comments showed that his feud with federal law enforcement has taken on a new urgency.<br />â€œWhat is different now is that the Justice Department noose is tightening around the presidentâ€™s neck,â€� said Jack L. Goldsmith, a Harvard law professor who headed the Justice Departmentâ€™s Office of Legal Counsel under President<br />George W. Bush<br />. â€œThat context makes this confrontation more significant, for it might indicate that the president is finally going to follow through on his threats and insinuations, over many months, about firing Justice Department officials or taking other actions against the Mueller investigation.â€�<br />Mr. Grassley also reached out on Thursday to lawyers representing Mr. Cohen, inviting him to testify privately before the Senate Judiciary Committee. Republicans on the panel have led an intermittent investigation of the Trump campaignâ€™s ties to Russia but have not sought new witness testimony in months.<br />Maggie Haberman contributed reporting from New York, and Eileen Sullivan from Washington.<br />Get politics and Washington news updates via<br /
