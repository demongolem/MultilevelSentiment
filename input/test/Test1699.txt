The don, John J. Gotti,<br />died in a federal prison<br />in 2002, while Donald J. Trump went on to be president of the United States.<br />Now, as Mr. Trump faces his own mushrooming legal troubles, he has taken to using a vocabulary that sounds uncannily like that of Mr. Gotti and his fellow mobsters in the waning days of organized crime, when ambitious prosecutors like Rudolph W. Giuliani tried to turn witnesses against their bosses to win racketeering convictions.<br />â€œI know all about flipping,â€� Mr. Trump told Fox News this week. â€œFor 30, 40 years Iâ€™ve been watching flippers.

Flynn, over his connections to Russia.<br />â€œWhen I first heard that Trump said to Comey, â€˜Let this go,â€™ it just rang such a bell with me,â€� said Nicholas Pileggi, an author who has chronicled the Mafia in books and films like â€œGoodfellasâ€� and â€œCasino.â€� â€œTrump was surrounded by these people. Being raised in that environment, it was normalized to him.â€�<br />Mr. Pileggi traced the presidentâ€™s language to the Madison Club, a Democratic Party machine in Brooklyn that helped his father, Fred Trump, win his first real estate deals in the 1930s. In those smoke-filled circles, favors were traded like cases of whiskey and loyalty mattered above all.<br />Mr. Trump honed his vocabulary over decades through<br /
