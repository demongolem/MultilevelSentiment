Global Fresh Food Packaging Market - Overview The global fresh food packaging market is a very dynamic market and is expected to witness high growth over the forecast period. The growth is influenced by the undertaking of various government initiatives towards food safety and increase in demand for small portion food items/demand for single use packaging. However, inclination towards fresh cooked food is expected to hinder the growth of the market. To improve hygiene in food processing, different measures are being taken by the governments of various countries to ensure food safety. Thus, the packaging of processed food products has become an important step to ensure safety and hygiene of food products. The government has come up with several schemes to provide financial assistance for setting up and modernizing food processing units. With the change in the consumer lifestyle and the increasing trend of smaller families, the food items packaged in smaller portions are being demanded more.

Another important utilization for single-layer films is in freezer storage. With the increasing adoption of convenience shopping, the retail sector is growing rapidly.
