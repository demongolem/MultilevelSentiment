5:41 AM EDT Aug 17, 2018 'Heartless psychopath': Police find bodies believed to be man's missing wife, daughters 5:41 AM EDT Aug 17, 2018 By Associated Press
Authorities on Thursday discovered three bodies they believe to be a missing Colorado woman and her two young daughters, officials said. Police are working to confirm their identities.
Shanann Watts, who was 15 weeks pregnant, was reported missing Monday along with her two daughters, Bella, 3, and Celeste, 4. Her husband, Chris Watts, was taken into custody Wednesday night and is being held in the Weld County Jail, north of Denver, the Frederick Police Department said in a statement. Advertisement
"At this point we have been able to recover a body that we're quite certain is Shanann Watts' body," Colorado Bureau of Investigation Director John Camper told reporters Thursday.
The same day, Frederick Police said they believed they found the bodies of Bella and Celeste.
"High ranking sources" told The Denver Channel that the bodies of Chris Watts' daughters were found inside oil and gas tanks that "were mostly full." The sources said the bodies were likely placed in the tanks in order to hide the bodies and conceal the smell.
Watts was arrested on three counts of first-degree murder and three counts of tampering with a deceased human body, a Weld County District Court judge said during Watts' court appearance on Thursday. Prosecutors have until Monday to formally charge Watts.
The adult woman's body was found on the property of a petroleum and natural gas exploration company, Camper said. The company said Watts used to work there, but declined to say when his employment ended.
Police declined to say where the children's bodies were discovered but said they were found "in close proximity to the other body whom officers strongly believe is Shanann's."
Authorities have not revealed a possible motive or other details in the case. A judge sealed the arrest affidavit, which might have provided that information.
"This is absolutely the worst outcome that any of us could have expected," Colorado Bureau of Investigation Director John Camper said Thursday during a press conference. "As horrible as this outcome is, our role now is to do everything we can to determine exactly what occurred."
Sources told The Denver Post and CBS Denver that Chris Watts confessed to killing his wife and children. In Thursday's press conference, officials declined to confirm that he had confessed.
According to KDVR , a family member posted on Facebook late Wednesday night that "Chris Watts admitted to murdering my family."
Frankie Rzucek, who is identified on Shanann Watts' Facebook page as her brother, posted overnight on his page saying he just wanted "to know why."
"I just want 30 seconds alone with that heartless psychopath. May Satan have mercy on his soul," Rzucek wrote . "Doesn't take a genius to know who was suspect."
Chris Watts spoke previously with The Denver Channel and pleaded for his family's safe return.
He said his wife returned home about 2 a.m. Monday after a flight for a work trip was delayed. He said the two had an "emotional conversation" before he left for work a few hours later.
In the interview, which can be seen below, Chris Watts said his wife's purse, keys and phone were all left at home before she went missing.
"It's not something I could ever, ever fathom would happen in my lifetime, and I have no inclination of where she is," he said, at the time. "She said she was going to a friend's house with the kids and that's the last thing I heard, and that was it. It was very vague."
The station concluded the interview asking what would Watts tell his wife and kids if they could see the interview.
"Shanann, Bella, Celeste... if you're out there, just come back," he said, looking into the camera. "If somebody has her, please bring her. ... This house is not complete without anybody here. Please bring them back."
"I don't feel like this is even real right now. It's like a nightmare I can't wake up from," Chris Watts told " Today " Wednesday morning.
The FBI and Colorado Bureau of Investigation are also investigating.
According to the Times-Call, a family friend called police Monday afternoon to report Shanann Watts missing after she missed an appointment.
"There is a lot at stake here," Frederick police Sgt. Ian Albert said, adding there was no reason to believe there was any risk to the public.
Watts was 15 weeks pregnant and police said the children might have medical issues. The three reportedly did not take a family vehicle when they left.
The couple lived in Frederick, a town of about 8,600 people around 30 miles north of Denver.
Neighbors said the Watts family was quiet and kept to themselves. Cheryle Hallowell said she would sometimes see Chris Watts pulling his daughters in a wagon while walking their dog.
"The dog makes more noise than them," she said.
Shanann Watts' Facebook account paints a portrait of a happy family, with a constant feed of photos and videos of her family, friends and herself. Her comments are typically upbeat and say how happy she is, whether she's running errands, playing with her kids or promoting a health program.
She posted selfies of her and her husband smiling in restaurants, in front of the ocean on vacation and at their house. On one from May 5, she wrote: "I love this man! He's my ROCK!"
She posted a photo on June 19 of some texts with her husband after sending him a sonogram. He replied that he loved the baby already. She posted: "I love Chris! He's the best dad us girls could ask for."
Her page has photo collages and video slide shows praising Chris Watts for taking care of her and their girls, how their love was growing stronger and how he was why she was brave enough to agree to a third child.
The couple filed for bankruptcy protection in 2015. They estimated they had the same range of assets as liabilities, according to court records.
A family friend told People that the two "were having marital problems and she was getting ready to leave him.
