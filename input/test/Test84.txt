Millions of people uncomfortable talking about death, study finds Author: Alan Jones , 17 August 2018
PEOPLE often only start to consider their mortality after the death of a family member, a medical diagnosis or when they reach a milestone age, according to a new study.
Research by the Co-op suggests millions of people are uncomfortable talking about death.
More than 30,000 responded to the survey, with half saying the loss of a close relative or friend is their first recollection of death.
The death of a family member was the main reason for considering mortality, followed by reaching a milestone age, medical diagnosis and news reports of death.
The Co-op suggested asking someone if they are okay, offering to help, or giving them time off work are most helpful during a bereavement, rather than avoiding the subject.
Robert MacLachlan, managing director of Co-op Funeralcare and Life Planning, said: "We see increasingly that a failure to properly deal with death has a knock-on impact for the bereaved, affecting mental health and also triggering financial hardship.
"We're committed to doing right by our clients and more needs to be done nationally to tackle this.
