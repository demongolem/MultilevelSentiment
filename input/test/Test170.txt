61 IIB Council Unveils its First-ever 12-Week Digital Marketing Program: CDM Live The new revolutionary course includes weekly projects for students to practice on, Live Q&As every week during class, and premium course customization for the ultimate learning experience! With digital marketing channels being essential for the growth of leads and sales in any organization today, there has been a corresponding surge in demand for those who have the skills to deliver those results in this new digital age. However, according to research by Marketing Hiring Trends, there is still a significant gap between supply and demand in digital marketing roles, with demand sitting at 57%, and supply at only 27%. The numbers are really staggering! This has led, consequently, to an upsurge in educational programs when it comes digital marketing, and as a leading training and certification program, IIB Council had to introduce a program that helps students, not only learn but apply, the latest digital marketing tools and technologies in their own businesses. So, what is different about this program? Well, IIB Council has been working diligently for months to make sure that this program is different than anything else on the market today. This happens through a full-immersion learning experience with the help of live instructors who will deliver the course on a weekly basis for 12 weeks. The course is delivered over this period to allow for students who would be busy with a job or running their own business to attend the classes and achieve the same results as fully-dedicated students! Additionally, the course is built with practical insight at its heart, with over-the-shoulder level of instruction during classes that shows students exactly how to use platforms like Google Analytics, Facebook Advertising, Google Ads, and many more. Also, the course comes with weekly projects that allow students to practice everything they learned during the class. These projects come with two options: 1) practice with real-life business scenarios. 2) practice in their own businesses or even learn how to apply the lessons in the startup they want to create. Moreover, students who sign up for the first class will get also 3 coaching sessions with digital marketing experts that will help navigate their career moving forward beyond the course. Finally, this premium experience would be missing something if it didnt include some form of customization. Thats why IIB Council is very happy to announce that every student who signs up will be able to schedule a call with one of their consultants to know his/her background and needs and make sure this information is delivered to the instructors so they can be able to customize the training accordingly. Not only that, but students who sign up now will get a very special launch price. This is truly groundbreaking! To deliver on these very bold premium promises, IIB Council is limiting the number of students who can attend to only 30 to make sure that every student has the best learning experience ever.
