INSTRUCTIONS Cook together sliced mangoes, turmeric powder, chili powder, green chili, and salt with 2 cups water. Bring it to boil and let it simmer, till the mangoes are cooked and reach a mushy consistency. Grind together coconut and cumin with 2-3 tbsp water to a smooth paste. Add ground coconut paste to cooked mangoes and mix well. Let it cook for 5-7 mins on low â€“ medium flame. Remove the pan from the fire (to avoid splitting/curdling) and gradually add yogurt/buttermilk. Gently mix till no white traces are seen. Bring it back to fire and cook on low flame for 5-6 mins, till steam comes from the back of the spoon. Do a taste test and add more salt, sugar (if required). Heat oil in a small pan and crackle mustard seeds. Add curry leaves & dried red chili. Fry for 1-2 mins and add to the curry. Let the curry rest for 10-15 minutes before serving.
TIPS: Alphonso mangoes were used for this dish. You can use any sweet variety of mango. If using Nadan Mango, use 3-4. If using Yogurt, make sure you blend it in the mixer to make it smooth and remove any lumps. Those in the Gulf can use Laban. Full fat laban was used for this. Make sure yogurt / Buttermilk / Laban is at room temp, to avoid splitting of the curry. The curry has a well balanced sweet and sour flavor, so if the mangoes you use isn't sweet enough, add a tsp of sugar to balance the sourness. To reheat, keep the refrigerated curry at room temp for half an hr and MW for 30-40 seconds. Tag
