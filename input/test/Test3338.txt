Ricker's to Launch Frictionless Checkout The new hybrid checkout technology combines AmazonGo and mobile pay.
â€‹SALT LAKE CITY â€“ Ricker's and Skip announced the rollout of their new frictionless checkout technology that combines mobile pay and AmazonGo's "just walk out" experience to customers in 58 Ricker's stores in Indiana. The partnership will provide a best-in-class convenience store experience, offer easy access to promotional deals and enable customers to purchase in-store items at the pump or prior to arrival.
Skip said it selected Ricker's because of the chain's dedication to customer-centric retail experiences via clean convenience, a strong commitment to the Indiana community, best-in-class customer service and a long history of corporate trust. "We are so excited to work with Ricker's to tailor our proven product specifically to the convenience store customer experience. Their long-standing dedication to this objective and vision for the future was a match made in heaven for Skip," said Chase Thomason, CEO and founder of Skip, in a press release.
Ricker's has focused on providing best-in-class customer experience as a primary company initiative and by partnering with Skip, the chain continues this mission by adding frictionless checkout to its omni-channel solution for its customers. The benefit to Ricker's consumers is a simpler, faster and easier purchase process. Skip's technology reduces the speed of checkout from an average of 60 seconds to an instant pay-and-go action controlled by the customer. Via its partnership with Zipline, Skip also acts as a cost-cutter for retail businesses, bringing down transaction fees.
For Ricker's, Skip provides a competitive advantage expected to drive more transactions and frequency, including higher conversions from the forecourt to the food court. "By adding Skip to our arsenal of customer service competencies, we expect to see higher frequency and volume of transactions simply from the competitive advantage this partnership will provide. Not to mention being able to convert frequent fuel purchasers into loyal in-store customers," said Quinn Ricker, CEO and president of Ricker's.
Once the experience is fully optimized, including integrations with Zipline and Kickback Rewards, it will roll out across all Ricker's locations by the end of September
