When the going gets weird, the weird turn pro â€” and apparently join MSNBC.
One of the left-leaning network's political analysts just made a very bizarre declaration about conservatives, and it reveals a lot about how liberals in the media view the American people.
During a Thursday discussion, MSNBC commentator John Heilemann announced that he was "virtually certain" millions of Republicans "would be okay for Donald Trump to dissolve their own grandparents," if asked the question in a poll. Advertisement - story continues below
That off-the-wall analogy came after the panel discussed a poll showing that 4 in 10 Republicans support the president having authority to shut down media outlets that engage in bad behavior.
It was unclear what that "bad behavior" meant, and it is likely that many conservatives interpreted the question as referring to illegal or immoral actions by news outlets. TRENDING: Fox News Breaks New Viewer Record, Swamps CNN's Entire Brand
Heilemann went off on a strange tangent, claiming that a certain percentage of Trump supporters would support absolutely anything he wanted â€” including the deaths of their own grandparents.
"I would like a pollster ask this question: How many people in the Republican Party think that it would be OK for Donald Trump to dissolve their own grandparents?" Heilemann said, according to The Hill . Advertisement - story continues below
"I'm virtually certain that if it was a Donald Trumpâ€“related question, you'll get like 10 percent that would be like 'Donald Trump has the power to do whatever he wants, including kill my parents,'" he continued.

Considering the fact that just under 63 million Americans voted for Trump, the MSNBC pundit's theory would mean that six million people would shrug and say "sure" if asked by pollsters if the president could murder their grandparents.
Heilemann struggled to explain what in the world his point was.
"I think it's kind of a test," Heilemann said. "There are certain things, there are some people â€¦ that they just hear the question as 'the media is trying to test my loyalty to Donald Trump.' And if it's the question whether Trump has the authority to do anything, they will say yes no matter what that thing is." Advertisement - story continues below
This is how out of touch and bizarre â€” if not sick â€” the mainstream media has become. Think about it for a moment.
It couldn't possibly be that a high number of Americans are loyal to the president because they believe he is moving the country in the right direction after eight years of the opposite, could it? RELATED: Pelosi Sinks to New Low, Tells Dems: If You Have to Lie to Voters to Win, Do It
And it's impossible, at least in the minds of MSNBC's resident weenies, that a solid number of voters genuinely believe that the media is overstepping its bounds and are appalled that outlets like Facebook and Twitter are playing politics with who they promote or ban .
It apparently doesn't matter to Heilemann that those actions by the media might be borderline illegal and deserve to be stopped. The only explanation in his apparently twisted mind is that Republicans are robot-like sycophants who would let Trump dissolve their family members in acid. Advertisement - story continues below
Here's a clue, Heilemann: Maybe so many Americans are considering letting officials investigate and shut down biased outlets exactly because of disturbing views like yours. It's worth a thought. We are committed to truth and accuracy in all of our journalism. Read our editorial standards
