A Cambridge man was caught filming up women's skirts near Buckingham Palace - just a day before a new 'upskirting' law was introduced.

The 57-year-old admitted to officers when arrested that he had also recorded upskirt footage at Trooping the Colour â€“ a display of military precision, horsemanship and fanfare to mark The Queen's birthday.
Sentencing him at Westminster Magistrates' Court on Thursday (August 16), magistrate Jane Smith said: "It is a serious offence. You were uploading the images on to a website. You were recording them and there were several victims." 'Outraging public decency' Sivier was caught at Trooping the Colour, at Horse Guards Parade (Image: Getty)
Sivier, of Warren Road, Cambridge, admitted outraging public decency at a hearing earlier this month.
The charge stated that on June 20 at Horse Guards Parade in London he had used a camera while walking along to film under females' skirts.
At around noon on the day of the incident he was seen by police at the end of the Mall nearest to Buckingham Palace with a camera bag dangling near his ankles. Read More Man broke in- with a sock over his hand
The lens of the camera was poking out and pointing upwards, prosecutor Trevor Green told the court, while the rest of the camera was zipped away in the bag.
Police saw him "up close behind" a woman at that point and followed him as he made his way towards St James' Park where he was seen filming up another woman's dress. 'I have recordings' Richard Sivier leaving Westminster Magistrates' Court (Image: Kirsty O'Connor/PA Wire)
Sivier was also seen on a grassy area opposite Horse Guards Parade square trying to film under the dress of a woman pushing a pram, the court heard.
Mr Green said: "He followed behind her holding out the camera bag trying to film up her skirt."
He added: "Whilst under arrest Sivier said 'I have recordings of upskirts from the Trooping of the Colour'". Read More Woman had acid thrown over her
He was sentenced to eight weeks in jail, suspended for two years, and ordered to pay costs totalling Â£200.
Sivier was also banned, for the next two years, from having a camera capable of recording in a public place. What is upskirting?
The cruel and invasive craze involves perpetrators using cameras to take images or video up victims' clothing without their consent to see their genitals or underwear.
While the vast majority of known cases involve men targeting women, the roles sometimes can be reversed.
The first available data on the prevalence of upskirting showed victims as young as 10 complaining to police.
A new ban on the practice was introduced by Theresa May in June. 'Put his marriage in jeopardy'
At his sentencing hearing, Ms Smith said she had stopped short of preventing him from having a phone in a public place given his work, and the fact that mobile phones are an "essential part of daily life".
Sivier, whose occupation was not given in court, will also be required to do 100 days of the Horizon sex offending programme and 20 days of rehabilitation. Read More
Paul Dillon, mitigating, said Sivier had "difficulty coming to terms with his behaviour", was embarrassed by what he had done and realised it had put his marriage in jeopardy.
But he said his client was taking steps to change, including seeing a therapist. New law introduced - a day later Lucy Frazer: upskirting is "humiliating and degrading"
A law allowing upskirting offenders to be jailed for a maximum of two years â€“ in line with other voyeurism crimes - was introduced the day after Sivier's offence.
Before the law was introduced, upskirting was often successfully prosecuted under the offence of outraging public decency.
However, after concerns that potentially not all instances were covered by existing criminal law, the government decided to act.
At the time, Justice Minister and south east Cambridgeshire MP Lucy Frazer said: "The support for this new law from the public, campaigners, and across parliament shows just how seriously this crime is being taken.
"Upskirting is a humiliating and degrading practice.
"We will ensure this bill becomes law as soon as possible to protect more victims and properly punish offenders." Like us on Faceboo
