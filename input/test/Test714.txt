Salvation Army helps out during NorCal wildfires
In addition to all of the Marin County firefighters who have been "out of county" on the fire lines, thanks need to go out to the San Rafael Salvation Army's disaster canteen crew who are still at the Mendocino Fire Complex. Dispatched over two weeks ago, the canteen and crew has provided over 11,200 meals, 17,637 refreshments and 9,359 snacks.
The Northern California Salvation Army has provided five additional mobile canteen crews, with six additional officers and 32 volunteer crew members, making the number of six different feeding sites in the burned areas. San Rafael's Advisory Board volunteer crew members are Hunter Spencer, Dan Hanlon and Bob Rasmussen.
San Rafael Corps Officer Larry Carmichael has served as the incident commander for the Army's overall response, and is working at the Cal-OEC shelter at Mendo College in Lakeport. The Army's response will continue as evacuated residents return to their homes that have been vacated for over a week. While the evacuees return home, they will need food and other necessities to replace spoiled foods.
While the response is 100 miles away, we in Marin County can be assured that the Army is ready and staffed should such a terrible need ever occur here. Thanks again to the generous volunteers who gave so much of their time.

Consumers can demand fuel-efficient cars
Despite the Trump administration's effort to soften fuel efficiency standards, the real power to meet Obama-era standards lies in the hands of the California consumer.
With Detroit already planning for the 50 mpg target by 2025, falling electric vehicle prices, extended battery life, steadily improving charging station infrastructure and improved fossil fuel burning engine efficiency, California new car buyers are in an excellent position to reinforce this momentum, Washington notwithstanding.
Environmental advocates now have the internet and social media as tools for continuing to foster the higher standards. Car manufacturers will no doubt have to gear themselves to meet consumer demand to maintain market share.

Our diet can be a factor in solving climate change
With scorching heat and raging wildfires in the West and torrential downpours and massive flooding in the East, global warming is not just about a gentle sea rise any more. These tragic consequences of dumping greenhouse gases into our atmosphere calls for drastic remedies. Advertisement
For starters, we should re-join the Paris Climate Accords and actually become a world leader in reducing greenhouse gas emissions. One of the most effective ways is by changing our diet.
Yes, that. Last fall, Oxford University's prestigious Food Climate Research Network concluded that solving the global warming catastrophe requires a massive shift to a plant-based diet. A 2010 United Nations report blamed animal agriculture for 19 percent of greenhouse gas emissions, 70 percent of freshwater use, and 38 percent of land use.
Carbon dioxide is emitted by burning forests to create animal pastures and by transporting animals.
The more damaging methane and nitrous oxide are released from digestive tracts of cattle and from animal waste cesspools, respectively.
In an environmentally sustainable world, we must replace meat and dairy products in our diet with vegetables, fruits and grains, just as we replace fossil fuels by wind, solar, and other pollution-free energy sources.
Let's start with our next supermarket visit.

Here's one way Trump differs from other pols
President Trump, unlike other politicians, talks (or tweets) before he thinks.
But, also unlike other politicians, Trump evidently thinks before he acts. Hence his administration's significant impact (for good or ill, depending on your view).
While most politicians think carefully before talking (thus their typically studied, artificial, equivocal utterances), they either do not act at all, or, if they do act, they do not think carefully before acting.
