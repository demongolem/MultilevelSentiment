It aims to optimize logistics operations through analysis of data on stock, resources, and other elements using the logistics AI software, DyAS (R) (*), in addition to the application of state-of-the-art robots for practical operations.<br />In the collaboration, GROUND and HRG will build a logistics platform for Intelligent Logistics Centers (R) (*), which are next-generation logistics facilities that realize Intelligent Logistics (R) (*), and conduct a joint demonstration of logistics technologies such as robots and AI. In the logistics platform that the two companies aim to build, diverse logistics data will be accumulated and utilized, enabling automation and quicker operation by robots while AI ensures proper operations and creates rules. The companies plan to create a new service model, in which data will be linked between companies and between logistics facilities, and logistics assets will be liquidated, thereby enabling both software and hardware to be shared.<br />(Photo:<br />https://kyodonewsprwire.jp/img/201808237168-O3-19DhGc0r<br />)<br />In addition, given the ongoing rapid growth of the Chinese e-commerce market, sweeping logistics reform is called for in the Chinese city of Yiwu, which is one of the major cities under the One Belt One Road Initiative and one of the largest wholesale markets in<br />Asia<br />.<br />Through the joint demonstration of logistics technologies such as robots and AI and the establishment of a logistics platform, GROUND and HRG will promote the reform of the logistics infrastructure that supports Chinese wholesale markets, including the city of Yiwu, which plays an important role in the One Belt One Road Initiative.
