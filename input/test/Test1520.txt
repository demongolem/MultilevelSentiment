Lau<br />, Chairman of the Prize Recommendation Committee.<br />The 2018 Positive Energy Prize -- which this year had the Specific Area of Focus<br />Elimination of Illiteracy<br />-- was awarded to<br />Pratham Education Foundation<br />. Dedicated to improving quality of education and contributing to literacy attainment, Pratham directly helps one million children attain basic literacy and numeracy annually. Profoundly wedded to evidence-based models, it is now one of the largest NGOs in<br />India<br />and focusses on high-quality, low-cost interventions which address gaps in the education system. Through replicable, scalable models that emphasises on result-driven accountability, Pratham is able to achieve lasting and widely influential success in<br />India's<br />educational landscape and beyond, creating an adaptable demonstration model for governments.<br />Dr.<br />Rukmini Banerji<br />, CEO of the Pratham Education Foundation, said, &quot;We are both surprised and delighted to have won the LUI Che Woo Prize! Our own values and vision of making the world a better, more positive place are very similar to that of the Prize, and this generous honour from an international award will greatly support the work of Pratham in continuing to promote quality education to the children who are most in-need.&quot;<br />The 2018 Welfare Betterment Prize â€“ with<br />Reduction of the Impact of Natural Disasters<br />being this year's specific area of focus â€“ was awarded to<br />World Meteorological Organi<br />z<br />ation (WMO)<br />. WMO sets worldwide standards and provides the framework for international cooperation by supporting its 191 member states and territories to implement the adopted policies, leading to better monitoring, forecasting and communication of meteorological hazards on a global scale. Its persistent effort is pivotal in the tenfold reduction in global loss of life from extreme weather, climate and water-related events observed over the past half-century.<br />Professor<br />Petteri Taalas<br />, Secretary General of the World Meteorological Organization, said, &quot;We are honoured to be recognised by the LUI Che Woo Prize for the Organization's long-term efforts in mitigating disaster losses related to extreme weather, climate and water events. As always, our top priority is to support our members in tackling weather, climate and water-related challenges. With the LUI Che Woo Prize, we will no doubt be even better positioned to lend our leading expertise and crucial support.&quot;<br />The 2018 Sustainability Prize -- this year with the Specific Area of Focus<br />Development of Renewable Energy<br />-- was awarded to<br />Hans-Josef Fell<br />. Internationally recognised as a founding figure of the global renewable energy movement, Mr. Fell has been an environmental pioneer since the 1970s. He founded the world's first energy community to produce solar power in 1994, transforming the market for renewable energy, and successfully fought for the adoption of the Renewable Energy Act in the German Parliament. This law has since been replicated over 100 times around the globe, contributing to changes in renewable energy practices worldwide. Building on his huge success in bringing<br />Germany<br />to be the world's first major renewable energy economy in 2000, he has since then been sharing best practices and negotiating with governments and parliaments worldwide to accelerate the global transition to 100% renewable energy, extending his impact to the global level.<br />Mr.<br />Hans-Josef Fell<br />said, &quot;Promoting sustainable energy with the goal of transitioning to 100% renewable worldwide has been my life's work. Being awarded the LUI Che Woo Prize is a great honour and will strengthen my future activities to energise people for a sustainable and peaceful world. Thank you very much.&quot;<br />Dr.<br />Lui Che Woo<br />, Founder &amp; Chairman of the Board of Governors cum Prize Council of the LUI Che Woo Prize said, &quot;This year's laureates have contributed tremendously in enhancing sustainability, welfare of mankind and bringing about positive energy, and are unanimously selected by the Prize Council. I am truly grateful for the concerted effort of the Prize Council, Prize Recommendation Committee and the Selection Panels to make the recognition of such outstanding laureates possible. Congratulations once again.<br />&quot;The Lui Che Woo Prize is sowing seeds of goodwill, hoping to spread the positive energy to a broader audience; yet your support to the Prize and its laureates on carrying on their meaningful works is what is truly instrumental to further broaden its influence.&quot;<br />Looking ahead, the Prize will continue to evolve and to further widen its scope of each prize category, enabling the nomination of more individuals and organisations which have made outstanding contributions across a broad array of diverse arenas.<br />The nomination period for the 2019 LUI Che Woo Prize will begin in September this year. The process of nomination is by invitation only. The LUI Che Woo Prize will send invitations to more than 1,000 nominators, including heads of universities, academic institutions and professional organisations.
