How To Add Amazon Gift Card Code To Amazon Account
Enter your claim code and click "Apply to Your Balance".
Your gift card fund will be added to your account and you can use these funds to make a purchase.
If your order total is more than your gift card funds, the extra can be paid for by credit card.
Note: A Gift Card Code is 16 characters long (including hyphens) and will usually contain both letters and numbers ( for example AS25-NJZ1JX-CZCP5 ). For plastic amazon gift cards, you may need to scratch off the coating on the back of the card to reveal the claim code
