Mumbai â€“ Powai Powai in Mumbai recorded 6.3% QoQ surge in rentals. Occupiers from diverse sectors such as engineering, manufacturing, logistics and flexible workspace operators were active in taking up space in 2018.

Pune â€“ Bavdhan Bavdhan in Pune saw a 4.2% rise in rents QoQ. The rental rise can be attributed to limit availability in existing Grade A stock.

Additionally, premium buildings in strategic locations should contribute to the bulk of these rent increases," says Surabhi Arora, Senior Associate Director, Research at Colliers International India
