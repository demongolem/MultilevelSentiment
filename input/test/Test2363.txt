NDO/VNA â€“ Vietnam wishes to cooperate with developed countries in general and Australia in particular regarding climate change response, head of the Party Central Committee's Economic Commission Nguyen Van Binh said on August 16.
Receiving Australian Ambassador for the Environment Patrick Suckling in Hanoi, the official further stressed that Vietnam has paid due attention to rapid and sustainable development. The country has been aware of risks and challenges caused by climate change, he said, noting that Vietnam has performed as a constructive member on global frameworks like the UN 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and the Paris agreement on climate change.
At the same time, Vietnam has issued policies and guidelines to effectively cope with impact of climate change, he added. The official said Vietnam is working to diversify sources of energy, improve the content of renewable and new energy towards greater sustainability, and ensure energy security, thus contributing to protecting the environment and promoting sustainable development.
For his part, Patrick Suckling placed great value on Vietnam's socio-economic development as well as progress made in the Vietnam-Australia strategic partnership, especially in trade and investment. Vietnam is one of the countries hardest hit by climate change, he said, suggesting the country roll out suitable policies, especially those on sustainable energy, in order to adapt to and minimise the adverse impact of the phenomenon.
Sharing Australia's models on climate change combat, the ambassador emphasised that developing clean and sustainable energy is an important step to reducing environmental pollution and a solution that matches Vietnam's potential.
The same day, Politburo member Binh hosted a reception for former US Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner, who is also President of Warburg Pincus, an American private equity firm. He highlighted the enhanced comprehensive partnership between Vietnam and the US across many fields, saying that Vietnam hopes to attract more US investors, especially in finance.
He also briefed his guest on Vietnam's economic situation, particularly the country's aim to stabilise the macro-economy and maintain its growth rate, as well as its preparations for possible impact of the global trade war.
Timothy Geithner expressed his optimism about Vietnam's economy holding a lot of potential, especially in terms of cooperation between the two countries. The guest said he is impressed by the country's marked growth and rosy economic forecast, noting that this is the reason for Warburg Pincus wanting to seek investment opportunities in Vietnam
