2- or 3-item list of things they like<br />.)&#8221; All have &#8220;FC Ambassador&#8221; in their name. All have links to an<br />Amazon warehouse tour service<br />.<br />And all ceaselessly communicate upbeat messages about how great it is to work at an Amazon warehouse and assuring everyone that they are not being forced to do this. The messages all seem cut from the same cloth, frequently along the same exact patterns:<br />Hello! I work in an Amazon FC in WA and our wages and benefits are very good. Amazon pays FC employess ~30% more than traditional retail stores and offers full medical benefits from day 1. Working conditions are very good- clean/well lit- Safety is a top priority at my facility!<br />&mdash; Phil &#8211; Amazon FC Ambassador  (@AmazonFCPhil)<br />Did you know that Amazon pays warehouse workers 30% more than other retailers? I feel proud to work for Amazon &#8211; they&#39;ve taken good care of me. Much better than some of my previous employers.<br />&mdash; Shaye &#8211; Amazon FC Ambassador  (@AmazonFCShaye)<br />August 21, 2018<br />On the contrary, we Amazon employees get paid very well.<br />In fact Amazon pays fulfillment center employees ~30% more than traditional retail stores. On top of that we also get full health benefits that includes dental &amp; vision! I almost forgot to mention&#8230;we also get stocks! <br />&mdash; Jeremy &#8211; Amazon FC Ambassador  (@AmazonFCJeremy)<br />August 18, 2018<br />The workers say that they don&#8217;t receive compensation for being ambassadors; it&#8217;s a &#8220;totally optional role&#8221; they have taken on voluntarily. They also claim to be warehouse employees in the ordinary sense. If so, they&#8217;re putting their numbers at risk by taking the time out to bang out long tweets hourly on how great they&#8217;re doing.<br />Their most frequent topics of conversation are how they get bathroom breaks, the pleasant temperature of the warehouses, the excellent benefits and suitable wages, friendly management and how the job isn&#8217;t monotonous or tiring at all. FC Ambassador Carol, for example, is downright elated to be a picker, and is clearly a Bezos admirer.<br />I love &quot;couch shopping!&quot;  It&#39;s ALMOST as much fun as being here at work in the FC.  As a picker, we get to see all the unique things people purchase.  It keeps the night interesting, waiting to see what is going to come across my screen next.<br />&mdash; Carol &#8211; Amazon FC Ambassador  (@AmazonFCCarol)<br />August 23, 2018<br />Amazon has really developed into something pretty amazing since it&#39;s start in 1994.  And I, for one, am sure glad it did.  I have been with the co just over a year, now and wouldn&#39;t trade my time in the FC for anything.<br />&mdash; Carol &#8211; Amazon FC Ambassador  (@AmazonFCCarol)<br />August 23, 2018<br />I can safely say that none of MY ideas have panned out anywhere near what Jeff Bezos has accomplished.  I am more than happy, though, to continue working here, at BFI4, in WA.  I receive a (more than fair) wage and work with some really good people. Making history, every day.<br />&mdash; Carol &#8211; Amazon FC Ambassador  (@AmazonFCCarol)<br /
