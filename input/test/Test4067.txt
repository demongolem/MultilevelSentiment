At a recent Finance Meeting of the South Molton Town Council a problem regarding the recycle bins at the rear of the Amory Centre was brought up by the Town Clerk, Andrew Coates:
It would appear all the waste and recycle is from businesses in town and the facility is meant for residents only. There is a sign up which says No Commercial waste but no one seems to be heeding that.
We would assume the council would be within their rights to take action against businesses and traders who use the 'domestic' waste facilities at the rear of the Amory Centre.
The Clerk has asked us to politely remind business not to use these facilities but to dispose of their commercial in a correct manner. Share this
