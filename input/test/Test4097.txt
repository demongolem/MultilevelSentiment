Juventus may have eked out a jaw-dropping Â£99.3 million for a 33-year old Cristiano Ronaldo but they are already seeing some of the rewards associated with having such a First Class global Mega star.
A few weeks ago, it was announced that that the serial Ballon d'Or winner had ended his ultra-successful nine-year association with Real Madrid, penning a four-year contract with the old lady on terms that will see him earn a incredible â‚¬30 million a year in Turin.
But while that amount is unarguably high for a player already at the twilight of his career, Juventus are already feeling the power of his brand in terms of shirt sales.
Yahoo Sport in Italy say that in just 24 hours of Ronaldo being announced as a Juventus player and CR7 shirts hitting stores, an incredible 520,000 shirts were sold either online or in-store.
What's more, these Adidas replica shirts are costing a reported â‚¬105 euros a pop and so if you do a bit of multiplication, you'll see that it's a truckload of cash made on sales.
Juventus don't quite recoup all of that money in revenue because that's not how shirt sales work contrary to what some have been led to believe, but the commercial and marketing gain is already evident. Ronaldo's signing will scale the Juventus global appeal to new heights.
In fact, Juve's social media growth has been bursting at the seams on their channels ever since they confirmed the arrival of Ronaldo, with Twitter, Instagram and Facebook numbers increasing big-time.
Ronaldo is taking on his usual No.7 shirt in his new challenge and is set for his first official debut this weekend.
