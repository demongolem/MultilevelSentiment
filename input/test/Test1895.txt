Lead researcher, Dr. Alastair Tombs, said about the people he interviewed as part of the experiment: "Quite a few people talked about using clothes to change their mood. If they get up and aren't feeling great, they would put on something that would brighten them up." They also found that we can potentially evoke happiness within ourselves simply by wearing an item that reminds us of a nice moment or that we were complimented on previously.
