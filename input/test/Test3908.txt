Cheniere Energy (LNG) Downgraded by Zacks Investment Research  Paula Ricardo | Aug 17th, 2018
Zacks Investment Research downgraded shares of Cheniere Energy (NYSEAMERICAN:LNG) from a buy rating to a hold rating in a research report sent to investors on Tuesday morning.
According to Zacks, "Following the Q2 earnings miss, Cheniere Energy has been downgraded to 'Hold" from "Buy". The firm posted a net loss in the recent quarter amid high costs. As it is, Cheniere is burdened with huge debt of over $25 billion which restricts its financial freedom. We also need to factor the ongoing trade tensions between U.S. and China which may impact the company adversely. Nonetheless, with its first-mover advantage in exporting liquefied natural gas from the United States, Cheniere is primed for significant revenue and earnings growth. The company's long-term contracts with over 28 countries protect its future income, while offering excellent cash flow visibility. In fact, despite weaker-than-expected Q2 results, Cheniere raised the lower end of its distributable cash flow, as a show of confidence on its robust operations. The interplay of these factors forms the basis of our cautious stance on the stock." Get Cheniere Energy alerts:
