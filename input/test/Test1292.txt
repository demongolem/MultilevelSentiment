The Combi has a cruising range of 350 kilometers and can go from 0 to 100 kilometers in roughly 6 seconds, so says the company.<br />Batteries for the new electric vehicle from Kalashnikov have a capacity of 90 kilowatts per hour.<br />At the same gun show where the new EV was unveiled, Kalashnikov also showed off a hybrid buggy and an electric motorcycle to complete its hattrick.<br />The four-seat buggy can purportedly achieve speeds of up to 100 kilometers-per-hour and has separate electric engines for its front and rear wheels, along with hydraulic shock absorbers.<br />the vehicles are a relatively recent addition to the Russian military&#8217;s mobility arsenal.<br />Kalashnikov&#8217;s new electric motorcycle for police units<br />Kalashnikov may have<br />Tesla<br />in its sights, but the car company likely has more to fear from U.S. regulators than it does from a Russian competitor.
