MARLBOROUGH â€“ Mosquitoes carrying West Nile virus were found on Bigelow Street this week during routine collections, but no residents or animals have tested positive for the virus.
Health officials announced the positive test this week. The Central Massachusetts Mosquito Control Project sprayed several areas Wednesday night, including Ahlgren Circle, Bergeron Road, Bigelow Street, Brazeau Circle, Cummings Road, Donohue Drive, Doucette Drive, Duca Drive, Evelina Drive, Houde Street, Jacobs Road, Millham Street, Peltier Street, Reynolds Court, Robin Hill Street, Rogers Avenue, Schofield Drive and Wyman Lane.
The state Department of Public Health lists the Marlborough region as moderate risk for West Nile virus. Mosquitoes have tested positive in Hudson and Northborough.
West Nile is most commonly transmitted to humans through the bite of an infected mosquito.
Health officials advised residents to protect themselves. While the virus can infect people of all ages, those 50 and older are at a higher risk for severe infection.
People can better protect themselves by wearing long sleeves and pants and applying insect repellent with DEET, permethrin, picaridin, IR3535 or oil of lemon eucalyptus, according to a press release Public Health.
State health officials suggest rescheduling outdoor activities that occur during the evening or early-morning hours, which are peak biting times for mosquitoes.
Health leaders recommend draining standing water â€“ such as empty and unused flower pots, wading pools and birdbaths â€“ because mosquitoes lay their eggs in standing water. Installing or repairing door and window screens can prevent mosquitoes from entering a home.
