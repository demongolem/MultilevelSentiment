Six charts on how the British drink<br />In 2016, the government cut the levels of alcohol it recommends for men and women to no more than 14 units a week - equivalent to six pints of average strength beer or seven glasses of wine.<br />At the time, England's chief medical officer, Prof Dame Sally Davies, noted that any amount of alcohol could increase the risk of cancer.<br />'Informed risk'<br />Prof Sonia Saxena, a researcher at Imperial College London and a practising GP, said the study was the most important study ever conducted on the subject.<br />She explained: "This study goes further than others by considering a number of factors including alcohol sales, self-reported data on the amount of alcohol drank, abstinence, tourism data and the levels of illicit trade and home brewing."<br />The study shows that British women drink an average of three drinks a day, and rank eighth in the world of highest drinkers.<br />British men by contrast, ranked 62nd out of the 195 countries surveyed, even though they also drink on average three alcoholic drinks a day. This is because the drinking levels were far higher generally among men, with Romanian men drinking more than eight drinks daily.<br />Around the world, one in three people are thought to drink alcohol and it is linked to nearly a tenth of all deaths in those aged 15 to 49.<br />Prof Saxena said: "Most of us in the UK drink well in excess of safe limits, and as this study shows there is no safe limit. The recommendations need to come down further and the government needs to rethink its policy. If you are going to drink, educate yourself about the risks, and take an informed risk."<br />How many units of alcohol are in each drink?<br />Large glass of wine - 3 units<br />Pint of higher-strength lager or beer - 3 units<br />Standard glass of wine - 2 units<br />Pint of lower-strength lager or beer - 2 units<br />Bottle of lager or beer - 1.7 units<br />Single shot of spirits - 1 unit<br />Source:<br />NHS Choices<br />Yet Prof David Spiegelhalter, Winton Professor for the Public Understanding of Risk at the University of Cambridge, sounded a note of caution about the findings.<br />"Given the pleasure presumably associated with moderate drinking, claiming there is no 'safe' level does not seem an argument for abstention," he said.<br />"There is no safe level of driving, but the government does not recommend that people avoid driving.<br />"Come to think of it, there is no safe level of living, but nobody would recommend abstention."<br />Related Topics<br /
