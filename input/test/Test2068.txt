In this Q&A, Southall joins senior vice president and chief marketing officer, Karen Hurst, for a discussion about Facebook, attracting followers, responding to reviews, and more. Why is social media valuable to Innovations? Who oversees social media?
David Southall : Social media is a necessity â€” it's one of the ways we communicate, find information, and buy products. I buy a lot of products on social, especially Instagram. It's easy, convenient, and quick. And whereas we do still have people who communicate with us the traditional way, we get a lot of questions, comments, compliments, and complaints through social media.
Karen Hurst : We have four administrators â€” David, me, and our marketing and IT directors. What's Hidden In Your Online Reviews?

KH : It's a broader channel where we can have a larger presence. Our communication is more in-depth because our messages aren't limited to a number of characters or a single photo. We do have some sponsored posts, but we mainly focus on the fun, publicity-type posts so people will want to come to our site.
DS : A lot of businesses and other financial institutions use it for posting an announcement like, 'We're closed today.' We like to share things that are happening at the credit union, like if we're opening a branch, having a celebration, or holding a team meeting.
Facebook also provides back-end reporting we use in analysis. We can see who visits our site, from where, for how long, what they do, and who they are. How do you use your page to engage people?
DS : I pay attention to our number of likes compared to nearby large credit unions. We're trying to get our likes to surpass one credit union specifically, and we're close.
We ran an internal campaign six months ago to try and get more likes for our page. We challenged our employees on Facebook to invite friends and family to follow us. We made it a competition, and our team members jumped into it. Our likes increased exponentially within just a few days.
KH : We try to keep content fresh. We don't want to be one of those sites that hasn't posted anything in months or has comments we haven't responded to. Our response time is one minute on average; our response rate is 100%.
We like to respond to everyone who posts, even if we just 'like' it. If we get complaints, usually there is some confusion. Sometimes the person is truly not happy with us, and David will give them a call to see if there is something we can do to make things better. We feel that's important.
