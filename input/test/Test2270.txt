2018-10-30 Power Quality Test Data Analysis for Aircraft Sub-System 2018-01-1932 Aircraft sub-system development involves various combinations of testing and qualification activities to realize a flight worthy system. The sub-system needs to be verified for massive number of customer requirements. Power quality (PQ) testing is also an important testing activity carried out as a part of environmental qualification test. It is intended to verify the functionality of sub-system with various power disturbances, to determine the ability of a sub-system to withstand power quality disturbances. The sub-system being designed should be reliable enough to handle power quality anomalies. Power quality test generates enormous amount of test result data for analysis with millions of data samples depending on the test, and can be identified as Big Data. The engineer needs to analyze each set of test data as a part of post processing to ensure the power disturbances during testing are as per the standard requirements and functional performance of the sub-system is met. Manually analyzing the test data with classical methods and generating the report requires more time and effort, as it needs analysis of millions of test data samples, also leading to possibility of errors. Hence it is required to have automated methods to perform unsupervised data mining in faster way and generate the post processed report as required by end user. This paper presents the testing of aircraft sub-system, for power quality with various power input disturbances involved, mainly focusing on test data analysis techniques using script based analysis tools. Also it discusses on the utilization of options available in various tools for automation of test data analysis and presentation.
