Drama<br />Where did the idea for Bodyguard come from?<br />It started out as a desire to set something within the political world - and find a different way into that. With my experience on Line of Duty I was aware of the different specialisations within the police, so the idea of the specialist protection unit, which looks after politicians, diplomats and royalty, felt like a really good area in which to set the story.<br />Can you tell us more about the story?<br />It&rsquo;s built around the character of David Budd, played by Richard Madden. David is someone who had first-hand experience of the traumas of war and has difficulties in his home life as a result of that. The show&rsquo;s premise is that we don&rsquo;t know a whole lot about David&rsquo;s motivations. He would appear to be a very highly respected and very proficient PPO assigned to Keeley Hawes&rsquo; character, Julia Montague, who is the Home Secretary. But the idea is that actually, rather than protecting her, he may be involved in some conspiracy to do her harm&hellip;&nbsp;<br />This assignment to look after quite a hawkish Home Secretary brings back the traumas and the conflicts that he feels about the experiences he had overseas in the army.<br />Can you tell us more about the other characters?<br />The political world within the story is something that really surrounds Julia Montague. As a high-ranking politician, she&rsquo;s obviously at the level where everyone is looking over her shoulder and also looking at the top job of trying to get into number ten. Julia&rsquo;s deputy is Mike Travis. The Chief Whip, Roger Penhaligon, is her ex-husband - they had a bitter break up. She&rsquo;s quite an ambitious figure - someone who is probably more on the right wing of the party in terms of her attitude to security. Our story has something called RIPA &rsquo;18, which is a bill that Julia is trying to get through the House of Commons. It is the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act for 2018 - something which is intended to beef up the surveillance powers of the security services.<br />Gina McKee plays Anne Sampson, the commander of&nbsp;SO15 - the counter terrorism branch. She&rsquo;s a very dedicated officer - but she&rsquo;s also someone that&rsquo;s quite hard to know. It does appear at times that she has her own political agenda&hellip;<br />It&rsquo;s hard to know who to trust in Bodyguard, isn&rsquo;t it?<br />I think it&rsquo;s very important, if you&rsquo;re doing post-watershed drama for a discerning audience, that you make it distinctive. A lot of TV does go for heroes and villains - and for very demarcated characters. One of the characteristics of Line of Duty and Bodyguard is that characters can have a bit of good and evil in them. They can be positive characters with very real flaws that lead to dramatic consequences.<br />One of the centrepieces of the story is the terrorist threat and unfortunately that&rsquo;s something that we&rsquo;ve all learned to live with in our big cities. It&rsquo;s very contemporary and obviously we want to handle that in the most sensitive way, but also in a way that does feel authentic. We have a number of big action sequences within the series and that&rsquo;s really part of the appeal of it, I hope.<br /
