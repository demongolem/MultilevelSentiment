His first quick-fire clip is on stop and search Christian Weaver
A budding barrister has come up with a clever way of helping people understand their rights â€” through the medium of vlogging.
Christian Weaver, a Nottingham Law School Bar Professional Training Course (BPTC) grad, has launched a YouTube channel with the aim of explaining various laws in under one minute.
In the first quick-fire clip, the 24-year-old provides a brief overview of the UK laws relating to stop and search, including the powers the police have and what action you can take if you're stopped. The video was first uploaded to Weaver's YouTube channel and subsequently shared with his 1,000 followers on Twitter. It has already racked up over 1,500 views. Knowing your legal rights is something everybody should have time for. That's why I have created #TheLawIn60Seconds â€“ quick and easy videos that explain your legal rights.
The first episode is 'Stop and Search': https://t.co/1nzwZRaXVV

Speaking to Legal Cheek , Weaver explained his motivation behind the channel:
"Although people understand the importance of the law, very few people take the time to become knowledgeable in it â€” often deeming it too difficult or a time-consuming task. My #TheLawin60Seconds project identifies legal matters that relate to ordinary people and helps explain their rights in very simple terms. I hope my videos will be an educational resource â€” they only last 60 seconds so everyone should have the time to view them."
Weaver hopes to post regular content to his channel. Future episodes will touch on a range of issues, including the Grenfell Tower tragedy and whether shops can refuse to give consumers a refund.
Weaver completed his LLB at Nottingham Law School and stayed on after graduating in 2015 to complete the BPTC. Since then, the aspiring barrister has volunteered for various legal charities including human rights organisation Liberty. The 2018 Legal Cheek BPTC Most List
The 24 year-old is currently the UK's youth delegate for the Council of Europe and works as a trainee caseworker for legal charity INQUEST. Weaver confirmed to Legal Cheek that he will be commencing pupillage at a human rights set later next year.
This isn't, however, the first time we have seen a law student turn to YouTube to share their wisdom.
Earlier this year , Legal Cheek reported on Ludo Lugnani, a Univesity of York LLB-er who runs a channel called The Business Update . Ideal pre-training contract interview viewing, Lugnani posts short video clips updating his followers on the latest commercial awareness issues. And it's not just law students taking to YouTube either. Irwin Mitchell solicitor Chrissie Wolfe shares, among other things, her top training contract tips on her channel, Law and Broader .
