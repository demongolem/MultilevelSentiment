On August 30 and 31, Nepal will host the fourth BIMSTEC Summit in Kathmandu with Prime Minister Narendra Modi and other heads of government expected to attend the summit. Founded in 1997, the Bay of Bengal Initiative for Multi-Sectoral Technical and Economic Cooperation (BIMSTEC) includes Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, Myanmar, Nepal, Thailand, and Sri Lanka, but has often struggled to develop regional cooperation and greater connectivity between South and Southeast Asia. What can we expect from the BIMSTEC summit in Kathmandu? Will BIMSTEC replace the South Asian Cooperation for Regional Cooperation? What challenges and opportunities lie ahead for the connectivity and integration agenda around the Bay of Bengal?
To discuss some of these questions, you are cordially invited to an event with a special address by H.E. Mr. Chutintorn Gongsakdi, Ambassador of Thailand to India. This will be followed by a panel featuring recent research publications about BIMSTEC, including a study by Constantino Xavier, Fellow, Foreign Policy at Brookings India; an edited book by Prabir De, professor at RIS; a report by Rajiv Bhatia, Distinguished Fellow at Gateway House; and a paper by Joyeeta Bhattacharjee, Senior Fellow at the Observer Research Foundation. The discussion will be moderated by Sreeradha Datta of the Vivekananda International Foundation.
The event will be on-the-record and open to the media. All participants are requested to register their attendance with Shruti Godbole at sgodbole@brookingsindia.org. More Information Brookings India 01124157753
