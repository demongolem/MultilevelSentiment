Such a fan of Apple! A Melbourne high school kid has been facing criminal charges for hacking into Apple's mainframe downloading 90GB of 'secured files' and access into Apple customer accounts. The Melbourne schoolboy has repeatedly broken into Apple's secure computer system because as his lawyers state that he was a big fan of the company.
Due to some legal reasons, the identity of the student cannot be revealed but as the reports say â€“ the 16-year-old continued hacking for over a year on many occasions. The teen broke into the company's mainframe from his suburban home.
The teenage boy also reportedly accessed customer accounts. It took some time for Apple to detect the breach and when finally it was detected it reported it to the FBI, which launched an investigation. When the source of the intrusions was traced to Australia, the Australian Federal Police (AFP) joined which became an international investigation. FBI reached out to Australian Federal Police (AFP) to track the teenager and finally arrest him and seize his systems.
The teen is quite known for hacking into the hacking community using VPNs and other tools which made him easier to not be traced. But Apple's systems logged the serial numbers to detect and trace the breach. The boy had kept all the downloaded materials in a saved folder named 'hacky hack hack'.
As for detecting the link The Australian Federal Police executed a search warrant on the teen's home last year, "two Apple laptops were seized, a mobile phone and a hard drive were also seized and the IP address matched the intrusions into the organization."- A prosecutor said.
The boy has been reportedly using WhatsApp to send the keys to others. He brought forth his dream of "working for Apple". The case has been put down until the next month due to its complexities
