As a result, it steals a march over other radiation therapies that affect adjacent areas too. Brachytherapy devices are typically used in high precision treatment of small tumors, mostly found in early stages. Besides, cancer patients treated with brachytherapy devices show limited possibility of recurrence of the condition. In addition, they help to bring down both time and cost of treatment. All the aforementioned benefits of brachytherapy devices is fuelling their demand. "Increasing knowledge about the different advantages of brachytherapy devices among healthcare practitioners would work in favor of the market in the next few years," explains the lead analyst of the TMR report. He adds, "In the next couple of years, the market could benefit from the swift progress in the field of image guided procedures and radiation dose delivery." Growing range of products with 3D treatment planning technology to facilitate accurate treatment is also expected to stoke growth in the market. Soaring popularity of medical tourism, in which patients travel to other regions for better or cost-effective treatment, or both, is predicted to catalyze growth in the market too, along with emergence of innovative products, namely electronic brachytherapy devices. The growth rate in the global market for brachytherapy devices will however be stymied on account of upcoming external radiation treatment methodologies. Concerns pertaining to procurement, storage, and handling of radiation sources are also posing a challenge to market.
