A decade passed between the Litchfield girls tennis team's last section title and state tournament appearance prior to last season. After ending that streak last season, head coach Matt Draeger hopes that a calendar year is long enough to wait to place at state again.
"We want to place in the state tournament," he said. "Win our section, that's first and foremost, and then try to place in the state tournament."
Litchfield hadn't been to the state tournament since 2007 before last season, but it won the Section 5A title and went on to place fifth at state.
While that was a successful season for the Litchfield team, it also left its members hungry for more this season.
"We're hoping to get back there and just get a better place than we did," senior Laney Huhner said.
Huhner is among a number of impact performers who are returning from last year's team. Huhner is joined by others who played at the state tournament last year, including Shanna Kinny, Vaida Behnke, Neriah Lara, Avery Stilwell and Taylar Smith.
"Most of these people have been playing since seventh and eighth grade," Draeger said. "It's not just last year. We have a core who has been here four years or more and that's always nice to have."
Lara echoed Draeger's thoughts, as the team members' familiarity with each other plays an important factor.
"We all have confidence in one another since we've been playing together for awhile," Lara said. "We're super close together, we have a good team bond."
Kinny played in the No. 1 singles spot for Litchfield last year, and returns as the favorite in that slot. She also placed third at state in the doubles tournament last year, alongside Stilwell.
Huhner and Behnke were partners in the state doubles tournament as well, and Elise Bierbaum returns, fresh off a fifth-place finish at the state tournament singles competition.
Two girls gone from last year's state team are Natalie Nelson and Alanis Thesenvitz, who played the No. 2 and No. 3 singles spots, respectively.
Even with their losses, the return of much of last year's team projects Litchfield as one of the top-ranked teams in the state coming into this season. Other teams could view the Dragons as a tough challenge to be gunning for, but Huhner says that that's not how they see it.
"I think they think that of us, but we don't think that of ourselves," Huhner said. "We're from Litchfield, a little town, and we're thinking 'We're just out here playing and whatever happens, happens.'"
The Dragons are still building their complete varsity lineup through this week, and it won't be long until it gets put to the test. Litch opens with the Pine City Invitational on Monday, which Draeger views as one of the toughest tests on the calendar with Rochester Lourdes and Bemidji among those in attendance.
"I find out a lot about our team that first day because we play a lot of good competition," Draeger said. "We leave there a lot better after playing three matches in a day than we were when we went in. That's really what we're trying to accomplish with that, is to be a lot better at the end of the day than we were at the beginning, and that's usually the case because you're forced to."
The invite will serve as an early measuring stick as the Dragons play against some opponents they may see down the line at the state tournament. But with state still two months away, and a section title anything but a certainty, Draeger just wants his girls to focus on progressing and not getting caught up in their chase to return to state.
"I think the goals are to focus on daily goals and getting better, and not worrying about what's going to happen at the end of the year," Draeger said. "You've got to worry about getting better every day and competing on a daily basis, and just approach every day with the mindset of playing at a high level.
