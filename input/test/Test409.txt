Speaking about 'Outside', the band said: "Medicine, the justice system and bad architecture get the Drenge treatment, whilst the rhythm section try to find some order amid all the ranting and discordant guitars."
Drenge have also released the video for 'Before the War Begins', which features the band's "research robot".
"For 'Before the War Begins' we sent our research robot, DR3-NG3, to look for civilisation on a distant planet," they remarked about the strange set-up of the clip.
"We have been working on developing the robot over the past three years and this is his first intergalactic mission. Naturally, we've had to keep our work top secret to avoid being copied or beaten by other music industry space programmes, and we feel like the resulting video is worthwhile proof of our exciting work."
Drenge are set to play a show at Cardiff University's Great Hall in October â€“ you can find tickets here.
