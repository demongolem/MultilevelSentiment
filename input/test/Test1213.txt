Clapton boss Fowell hoping to have more of his squad fit to choose for Stanway trip PUBLISHED: 10:00 17 August 2018 Action from the Essex Senior League match between Clapton and Tower Hamlets (pic Tim Edwards) Archant Clapton manager Jonny Fowell is hoping to have a few of his first-team squad return from injury for their clash with Stanway Rovers this weekend.
The Tons will travel to Essex Senior League new boys Rovers on Saturday looking to get back to winning ways in the league at the Hawthorns.
The Clapton boss is hopeful of having a few players returning and admits he is looking forward to a new challenge against the former Eastern Counties Football League Premier Division outfit, who were moved across leagues in the summer.
"They have started the season a bit like us, indifferent," Fowell said.
"The difference is we will have all our players coming back into the line-up.
"We should have Steven Sardinha, Tayo Aduwero and Jeffrey Cobblah back so it will be good to get them all back involved."
With goalkeeper Clapton goalkeeper Joe Phillips ruled out for quite some time after picking up a neck injury in a 2-0 defeat against Ilford, Fowell admits they will be on the look out for some cover in the sticks.
He added: "With Joe out for at least a month or five weeks we will be looking to bring in a new goalkeeper before Saturday or see who is available for us."
The former Enfield under-21 coach also insisted it will be a tough test against Rovers, but it is one he is really looking forward to this weekend.
"It will be a difficult game like all games will be this season, but we know we can beat anyone in this league on our day, it's all about making sure we have our best 11 all performing when possible," Fowell said.
"Stanway is a new ground so it will be interesting to go there and see what it's like.
"Hopefully the hospitality will be as good as when we went to Woodbridge Town last weekend."
Fowell also revealed he does not know too much about the league's new boys, but will not be phased by any of their opponents this campaign.
He concluded: "I only know the way they play from speaking to a few different people, but to be honest I'm not a massive believer of worrying about oppositions, I just want to worry about my own side and how we play." Topic Tags
