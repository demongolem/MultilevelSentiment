Snapshot of Chair's Letter of Invitation:
"Immuno-oncology (IO) is a fast-paced and exciting area of medicine with the potential to deliver highly beneficial and durable cancer therapies for patients. Recent years have seen an exponential increase in the positive outcomes of discoveries and preliminary trials for treatments, and with that has come a surge of new investment into next generation therapeutics. It is these next generation therapeutics that are likely to herald the future successes of the field.
The programme will draw together key themes within IO and tackle some of the common challenges faced, where participants will be able to learn directly from the experiences of prominent speakers and key opinion leaders. The agenda will include discussions on areas of development and clinical application which hold the most promise for creating the novel and effective immuno-oncological therapies of the future. It will also cover issues surrounding research and ethics within immuno-oncology.
Building on the early successes in the field, I am particularly looking forward to hearing about the many innovative approaches being taken to improve patient outcomes further. At the forefront of these are: applications of bi-specific molecules to increase efficacy and therapeutic index compared to conventional antibodies; the engineering of highly potent and selective CAR-T cells; combinations of immuno-oncology agents with antibody drug conjugate; further development of cancer vaccines; and a multitude of combination approaches."
