High marks for innovation and social responsibility helped make Weyerhaeuser Co. the highest ranked among real-estate and construction-related companies in the Management Top 250.
The Seattle company scored in the top 1% of all companies analyzed for innovation, which measures things such as research-and-development spending and statistics on patents.
For social responsibility, which measures companies' environmental, social and corporate-governance policies, Weyerhaeuser scored in the top 7% of companies.
Overall, Weyerhaeuser was ranked No. 17 in the Management Top 250. Five real-estate or construction-related companies made the ranking of the most effectively managed major companies.
The Management Top 250 uses the ideals and teachings of the late business guru Peter Drucker to analyze and compare U.S. companies. Mr. Drucker influenced generations of business leaders with his writings, including a regular column in The Wall Street Journal.
The ranking, compiled by the Drucker Institute and first published in December, examines how well a business does in five areas: innovation, social responsibility, customer satisfaction, financial strength, and employee engagement and development.
