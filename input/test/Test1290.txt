"We shot ourselves in the foot and basic defending let us down.<br />"Character of the team and its desire to do its best in training is not in question, what it lacks is mental strength to do what Fleetwood did better than us throughout the game, which was defend as a team.<br />"We have quality, I don't think that's in question. There's work to be done in terms of understanding, we've got another game on Saturday against Barnsley and we will do our best to get the team ready for the weekend.<br />"It's harsh to say we lack quality, we lack a little bit in certain areas but that's for us to sort out."<br /
