Rapid Industrialization and Urbanization Boosting Market's Growth
The global low voltage (LV) and medium voltage (MV) switchgear market is being driven mainly due to a rise in demand for enhanced protection in electricity distribution systems. The demand for switchgear is also expected to increase owing to rapid industrialization and infrastructural development taking place all over the globe. With rural development and urbanization mushrooming rapidly, the construction of electricity transmission lines and distribution networks is highly necessary. Low voltage (LV) and medium voltage (MV) switchgear play a crucial role in setting up these networks, consequently driving the associated market.
High Costs of Manufacturing Equipment Restrains Market's Expansion
However, high costs required for manufacturing low voltage (LV) and medium voltage (MV) switchgear devices makes it substantially expensive for companies having less disposable income to work in this market. This causes them to settle on alternatives, consequently hindering the global low voltage (LV) and medium voltage (MV) switchgear market's growth. Lack of raw materials in several remote and underdeveloped regions needed to produce the switchgear is also restraining the market from a regional perspective. Nevertheless, some organizations are expected to introduce cost effective solutions, which may considerably reduce effects of restraints affecting the global low voltage (LV) and medium voltage (MV) switchgear market in the near future.
