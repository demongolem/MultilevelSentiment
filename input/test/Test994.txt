 Grealish sent a message on Twitter to pal Harry Winks on Instagram, responding to the picture the Spurs ace posted of him in training yesterday.
The Villa star responded with a quick message saying 'The wink man', to the Tottenham ace, showing his friendship with the England international.
Grealish was coveted by Tottenham boss Mauricio Pochettino in the summer but the Lilywhites were unable to reach an agreement with Aston Villa for his signature.
The Telegraph reported that Grealish was keen to move to Spurs , but the midfielder was always careful not to speak out of any supposed intention.
Going on strike at his boyhood club was never an option, and Grealish has enjoyed a solid start to the season for Aston Villa.
Villa are reported to be trying to trying to sign Grealish to a new contract, which The Sun report could include a buyout clause.
