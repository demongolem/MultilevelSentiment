What advice would you give teenagers about to embark on a far-flung adventure? - sturti More Now that the dust has settled on A-Level results day, students across the country are weighing up the pros and cons of a gap year. Are they an invaluable opportunity to learn more about the world (and yourself) â€“ or a waste of time and money? Perhaps you or someone you know is planning a gap year. So what sort of trips are most worthwhile? And what is the best advice for teenagers about to embark on a far-flung adventure? In Britain, the gap year reached its peak in 2008, when more than 21,000 18-year-olds deferred their university place to take a year out. But rising tuition fees saw that figure plummet to just over 7,000 in 2011. The decline in the value of the pound following the Brexit referendum has made an extended break even less economically appealing. All of which explains why today's gappers are increasingly looking for internships and work placements , often paid, which will help offset costs and will give CVs a genuine boost. So are we witnessing the death of the traditional gap year? Volunteering, meanwhile, remains a surefire way of getting to know a place and its people intimately. In recent years, however, there have been strong messages about avoiding volunteering in orphanages. So how can you make sure a trip is ethical?
