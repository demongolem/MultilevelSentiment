I have seen many sites which takes a lot of time to just load. What you think about this, you may also have gone through this kind of experience. This thing makes your visitor run away from your website. So, see how big this issue is and you should fix this as soon as possible. Following are the ways you can use to increase your site speed:
2. No Sitemap
Sitemap file is very important. Why is it important? Because you have the sitemap of your website it will help search engine spiders to find all your web pages very easily, so if they are able to find the web pages first of all then only they will index your web pages, right? And sitemap is like an informer to the search engines, it informs about if any changes or updations have taken place in your website.

3. Keyword Stuffing
What do you know about SEO? Do you think that for content optimization you need to repeat the keyword many times anyhow possible? I don't think it is the correct way of doing content optimization. For repeating the keyword a lot of time, you are actually spoiling your content. So think about it how your user will be satisfied after going through your content and we need to focus on our users first because as we know if users are not satisfied bounce rate will definitely increase.
4. Non-Responsive Website
I am not telling that this is the most important point and you should focus on this a lot. But let's assume that your content quality is best and site speed is also very good and all other things are on their place, but the problem is only that the website is not responsive or mobile friendly. Do you know there are about 5 million individual mobile users in the world? What do you think everyone will open your website on the desktop? Obviously no. In fact, if your website is not responsive then even Google can penalize your website
