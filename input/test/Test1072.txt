Over the past few weeks & months, we've been blessed to hear some dope collaborations thanks to producer DP Beats, who's released songs with Wiz Khalifa, Madeintyo, Rick Ross, Playboi Carti, Lil Uzi Vert, and more. Today, the Long Island-born producer decided to compile all his work into one place with the 3rd installment in his Dponthebeat series.
While we've already several of the songs from the project, one track in particular that's getting attention today is this brand new record from Wiz Khalifa & Travis Scott called "Trippin," which serves as the project's intro. The song was initially previewed on Instagram by the producer last year, building hype for the collab, but we pretty much forgot all about it until today. The only down side is that Travis is only responsible for the hook, and doesn't lay down a verse, but Wiz makes up for it.
Take a listen to the new ganja-inspired record and let us know what you think. Record available on iTunes.
