Giant Food has officially kicked off its 14th annual pediatric cancer fundraising program.
The Landover, M.D.-based company created the program to support pediatric cancer research during Childhood Cancer Awareness Month and has set a goal of $2 million to be raised between the weeks of Aug. 17 to Oct. 11.
Funds from the sales of $5 coupon books, which are valued at $50, will go directly to the John Hopkins Kimmel Cancer Center and the Children's Cancer Foundation.
"We are privileged to have the opportunity to support those that lead in pediatric cancer research and we look forward to raising awareness and funds for the Johns Hopkins Kimmel Cancer Center and The Children's Cancer Foundation again this year," Gordon Reid, president of Giant Food, said. "The Giant family, standing beside our local community, is motivated to help to raise money to advance the important work our partner organizations do."
Since 2005, Giant Food has raised $19.2 million for the cause, and this year will be launching a new initiative in addition to the sale of coupon books. The retailer will have bouquets of flowers with a Pediatric Cancer bouquet pick in them, and those purchased during the campaign will have $.50 of the proceeds go to the foundation.
"This annual program, made possible by Giant, is an important fundraiser for Johns Hopkins," said Dr. Donald Small, Director of Pediatric Oncology at the Johns Hopkins Kimmel Cancer Center. "It awards us the support to continue the research and treatment we need to help these children, so we are happy to be partnering with Giant once again.
