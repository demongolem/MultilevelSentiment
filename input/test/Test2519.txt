DUBLIN- The "Total Retail Software Market" report has been added to ResearchAndMarkets.com's offering
The Retail Software Market is exploding worldwide for two main reasons: retail in emerging economies is expanding, and enterprise retailers are re-architecting their systems for Unified Commerce (the systems that enable the procurement, sale and delivery of merchandise independent of channel) and Cloud computing (along with its cost efficiencies). The researcher projects the worldwide software market will grow 55% from $57.6 Billion in 2017 to $89.3 Billion in 2022.
