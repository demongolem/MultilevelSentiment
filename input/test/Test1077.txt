Arsenic Trioxideâ€“Coated Stent Is an Endotheliumâ€�Friendly Drug Eluting Stent
by Yinping Zhao, Ruolin Du, Tian Zhou, Dongchuan Yang, Yuhua Huang, Yi Wang, Junli Huang, Xiaoyi Ma, Fugui He, Juhui Qiu and Guixue Wang
Traditional drugâ€�eluting stents often delay endothelialization whilst inhibiting intimal hyperplasia. In their article, Juhui Qiu, Guixue Wang, and coâ€�workers describe an arsenic trioxideâ€�elutin g stent that effectively facilitates rapid reâ€�endothelialization whilst preventing inâ€�stent restenosis.
Chemically Modified Polyaniline for the Detection of Volatile Biomarkers of Minimal Sensitivity to Humidity and Bending
by Yunfeng Deng, Jiaxing Sun, Han Jin, Muhammad Khatib, Xianhui Li, Zongsu Wei, Feng Wang, Yehu David Horev, Weiwei Wu and Hossam Haick
In their article, Weiwei Wu, Hossam Haick, and coâ€�workers propose a strategy of oleic acid molecular layer assembly on PANIâ€�based flexible sensors to achieve tolerance of mechanical bending and humidity effects, up to 350 ppm. These results trigger the real application of flexible sensor applications in wearable devices for disease diagnostics.
Maximizing Aggregation of Organic Fluorophores to Prolong Fluorescence Lifetime for Twoâ€�Photon Fluorescence Lifetime Imaging
by Wenbo Hu, Lihong Guo, Lei Bai, Xiaofei Miao, Yun Ni, Qi Wang, Hui Zhao, Meng Xie, Lin Li, Xiaomei Lu, Wei Huang and Quli Fan
Lin Li, Wei Huang, Quli Fan, and coâ€�workers, report a simple approach to fabricate a waterâ€�soluble organic semiconducting nanoparticle for in vivo twoâ€�photon fluorescence lifetime imaging. The asâ€�prepared nanoparticles not only have strong twoâ€�photon absorption but also exhibit an ultraâ€�long, yet oxygenâ€�inert, fluorescence lifetime.
