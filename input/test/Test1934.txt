The bodies of a missing pregnant woman and her two daughters have been found as her husband appeared shackled in court after confessing to their murders.
Yesterday Mirror Online reported how Chris Watts sobbed on TV as he appealed for the return of his pregnant wife and kids before confessing he had killed them.
Earlier this week, Watts reported his pregnant wife Shanann Watts, 34, and their daughters, Bella, four, and three-year-old Celeste - who goes by the name Cece - as missing before confessing to police.
Watts, 33, was in handcuffs when he appeared in court in Weld County, Coloardo, on Thursday and was held without bail. Chris Watts arrived in court wearing an orange jumpsuit and handcuffs after confessing to killing his pregnant wife and children
Charges have not yet been filed but he could be charged with three counts of murder and three charges of tampering with evidence.
The judge told prosecutors to file charges on Monday and there will be a review in court on Tuesday.
Judge Marcelo Kopcow also granted a request from Watt' defence team that police keep all written notes during their investigation and notify his lawyers before the autopsies are carried out.
Prosecutors said they believe the family were murdered in the family home and the bodies were later moved.
Police are remaining tight lipped about the cause of death and whether the children were still alive when Shanann was killed.

The body of his wife Shanann, who was 15 weeks pregnant, has been found near the oil rig where he worked.
The Colorado Bureau of Investigation said in a press conference that officers believe they have discovered Shanann's body on a property owned by Watts' employer, Anadarko Petroleum.
Authorities also found the bodies of his daughters at the same site.

"This is absolutely the worst possible outcome that anyone could imagine," John Camper, director for the Colorado Bureau of Investigation, told a press conference.
"As horrible as this outcome is, our role now is to do everything we can to determine exactly what occured."
Shanann's family released a statement to CBS4, saying "It is with deep hurt, confusion and anger to confirm our beautiful cousin Shanann Watts, her unborn child, and her two angelic daughters, Bella (4), Celeste (3) were viciously murdered by husband Chris Watts; who confessed to the killings. Please keep Shanann's parents and brother in your prayers."
Her relatives also revealed she was pregnant with a baby boy who they were going to name Nico. Watts gave a number of interviews before confessing to the murders (Image: Instagram)
Shanann was reported missing on Monday after returning home from a business trip at around 1am.
Watts has spent the weekend at home with their children.
Chris said he last saw his wife at 5.15am before he left for work.
Speaking on NBC's Today show , Watts said he and Shanann had had an "emotional" conversation that morning and had stayed up talking but didn't give any further details. Shanann was 15 weeks pregnant with a baby boy (Image: Instagram)
He said: "I don't feel like this is even real right now. It's like a nightmare I can't wake up from."
He said Shanann was planning to go to a friend's house with their daughters and Fox 31 reports that was the last time he heard from her.
Watts said he saw his two girls asleep on the baby monitor as he left the house.
He said he text her numerous times but didn't receive any response which he thought was odd.
At around midday, he checked their doorbell camera and saw that a friend had stopped by but no one opened the door. Watts led police to Shanann's body and they later recovered the bodies of the two girls (Image: Instagram) Top stories straight to your inbox

Watts said he rushed home but no one was there, even though Shanann's car was in the driveway.
He then spoke to police and reported them as missing at 1.40pm.
Watts said: "When I got home yesterday, it was like a ghost town.
"I was trying to get home as fast as I can, I was blowing through stop lights, I was blowing through everything just trying to get home as fast as I can because none of this made sense."
Watts confessed to police after giving a number of interviews to national media.
Police have not said what prompted his confession but said he led officers to Shanann's body. Like us on Faceboo
