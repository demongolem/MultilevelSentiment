Among the rabbitholes into which the banking royal commission is peering is how superannuation funds justify the expenditure of members' money on advertising, marketing, sponsorships and corporate entertainment.
One of the biggest industry funds, the 1.1 million-member Hostplus industry fund, was in the spotlight before the commission this week for spending $266,000 to host its biggest employers at the Australian Open earlier this year.

Playing in 5 ... Don't Play Hostplus, like other industry funds, argued that the spending was necessary for it to maintain good relations with the major employers who have the funds as their "default" for employees.
Gaining and maintaining default fund status with employers matters because most people do not choose who manages their super but simply sign up to the fund nominated by their employer when starting a new job.
Hostplus was quizzed, as AustralianSuper was before it , on the millions of dollars it also spends on advertising, prompting questions about whether that was a good use of members' funds by a not-for-profit entity.

The banking royal commission has been examining the $2.6 trillion superannuation industry.

He points out that Hostplus' spending on advertising, marketing, sponsorships and corporate entertainment is paid for from the members' $1.50-a-week administration fee.
Alex Dunnin, the executive director of research and compliance at financial services information company Rainmaker Group, estimates not-for-profit super funds spend about $123 million a year between them on advertising.
At least that is what is disclosed to the regulator, the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority - though the spend will be much higher, as those figures do not capture all of the spending on marketing, sponsorships and corporate entertainment.
Mr Dunnin says most retail funds - those run by banks and wealth managers - do not disclose these costs at all.
Though the costs are not disclosed, they are likely to be much higher than the spending of not-for-profit funds, he says.
Hostplus' spending on entertainment and marketing is not confined to the Australian Open. The fund spent $21,440,832 on marketing in 2017 and an additional $266,964 on entertainment in the same year, a significant increase from 2013, when it spent $13,123,372 on marketing and $177,140 on entertainment.
David Elia, the Hostplus chief executive, told the commission: "We have key employers, key stakeholders, alliance partners flying in from all over Australia to participate in [the entertainment at the tennis] â€¦ It's a great time of the year for us to do that."
That's not a dissimilar spend to Australia's largest super fund, AustralianSuper, which spent $18.1 million last year on advertising and marketing in the media and workplaces. However, unlike Hostplus, AustralianSuper does not have a budget for corporate entertainment.
If competition in super worked properly, funds with the consistently best returns with the lowest fees would be attracting the most members.
Rainmaker's Alex Dunnin Elia told the commission that corporate hospitality was for the sole purpose of retaining the membership of Hostplus, despite also admitting to taking along his family when there were "spare" tickets.
"It's a great way certainly from my perspective and the executive team's perspective to establish very early on and retain the relationships that are absolutely critical in terms of retaining the default fund status of our members and therefore retaining members," he told the commission.
"It's a competitive market out there. Our competitors are doing exactly the same thing. In fact they were there."
Loading Superannuation experts like Dunnin argue that superannuation is not a market where members gravitate to the funds with the best returns.
Hostplus, for example, was not only the best performer for the year to June 30 , 2018, but also tops the SuperRatings tables over three, five, seven and 15 years.
"If competition in super worked properly, funds with the consistently best returns with the lowest fees would be attracting the most members," Dunnin says.
"But too often the funds attracting the most members are the ones with the best sales and distribution networks.
"To combat this, some funds invest in marketing, advertising and corporate networking and sponsorships even if they don't like doing it - they don't have a choice," Dunnin says.
Elia told the royal commission he wished he did not have to spend the money and that performance would speak for itself.
"There are so many irrational decisions being made," he said. "If it was a rational market, I think Hostplus â€¦ should be 10 times the size of AMP. It's just illogical to think how underperforming funds, high-cost funds, continue to grow at the expense of high-performing funds."
For-profit "retail" fund Russell Investments, which has 70,000 members and almost $9 billion in funds under management, illustrates some of the more creative ways others build funds under management.
It is promoting a competition for a Mini Cooper 3-door hatch, valued at almost $35,000, to attract members . To be eligible for the draw, consumers must transfer their super savings to the Russell Investments Master Trust, a superannuation fund.
The award program, which has run for several years, is paid for by Russell Investments, a spokesperson for the fund says.
"It is not funded by the trustee or by member money and only existing Russell Investments members are eligible for the program," the spokesperson says.
Rainmaker Information said Russell's MySuper default offering, where most people have their money, has a performance that is in the bottom 25 per cent of peer funds over each of one, three and five years; though the relative returns of its other investments options are better
