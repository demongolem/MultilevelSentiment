We are updating the EA website on Friday â€” to improve access for our existing readers and to bring in a new audience.
[While we are updating the homepage, you can reach our latest content via the menu â€”"Syria. Iran. United States. World"â€” at the top.]
EA will now stand for "Engagement. Analysis" as we offer a window on the world, from Syria to Iran to Europe to the US. Building on our foundation of engaging from the ground up with contributors and local groups, we will be expanding our news and analysis of these areas and looking to move into others.
There will also be a ground-breaking partnership with the University of Birmingham, linking the latest academic research to insight on current events, as well as our current link with the Clinton Institute of University College Dublin.
And, yes, there will be a new logo to reflect all of this.
Onward and upwards. Thanks to all of you. Share
