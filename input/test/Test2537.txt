A LITTLE MATTER OF SEMANTICS On 16/08/2018 15:05, Norman Wells wrote: rgghhh!Ã‚* They don't let GIRLS near computers now, do they? Whatever next! I'll assume that you're being ironic, but just in case you aren't, or in case of general interest, women have a long and honourable history in what is now referred to as computing, but, as others have mentioned, confusion is often caused by that term being formerly used to describe the process of computation by hand or with mechanical machines, which also was often done by women. The earliest female pioneer of the modern concept of a computing machine was ..."Ada Lovelace was a most unlikely computer pioneer. In this film, Dr Hannah Fry tells the story of Ada's remarkable life. Born in the early 19th century, Ada was a countess of the realm, a scandalous socialite and an 'enchantress of numbers'. The film is an enthralling tale of how a life infused with brilliance, but blighted by illness and gambling addiction, helped give rise to the modern era of computing." Jump forward almost a century and a half to the actual practical inception of such machines ..."For decades it was Britain's best kept secret, the huge codebreaking operation ... However, if you walked through the gates of Bletchley seventy years ago, you would have been struck not by the number of men working there but the number of young women. That's because by 1944 three quarters of Bletchley's workforce was made up of very young women, or girls, often just out of school. Tessa Dunlop speaks to some of those Bletchley girls, now in their late 80s and 90s, about their stories. Who were they and what did they do? Why were they selected to work in Britain's most secret organisation and what impact did Bletchley have on the rest of their lives?" Discovery - Stephanie Shirley: Software Pioneer"As a young woman, Stephanie Shirley worked at the Dollis Hill Research Station building computers from scratch but she told young admirers that she worked for the Post Office, hoping they would think she sold stamps. In the early 60s she changed her name to Steve and started selling computer programmes to companies who had no idea what they were or what they could do, employing only mothers who worked from home writing code by hand with pen and pencil and then posted it to her. By the mid-80s her software company employed 8,000 people, still mainly women with children. She made an absolute fortune but these days Stephanie thinks less about making money and much more about how best to give it away." Also the last episode of the most recent series of the Infinite Monkey Cage was recorded at GCHQ, and in it mention is made of the number of women in the audience (of GCHQ staff) and they also discuss briefly the preponderance of women at Bletchley Park in WW2 ...
