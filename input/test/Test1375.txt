It succeeded, just as the similar lies were providing you with hotel accommodation and money," he said.<br />"Your conduct from June last year was utterly disgraceful. You cheated and lied for your own ends, trading on others' misery. There can be little mercy in such a case."<br />The judge said Peters' crimes had reached "such depths as any right-minded member of the public would find repulsive".<br />The court heard Peters has 40 convictions for 90 offences, including 24 for fraud and 73 for theft.<br />He is the sixth person to be sentenced for fraud relating to the Grenfell fire and received the longest prison term yet.<br />Related Topics<br /
