A south coast man with mental health issues who was denied entry to his local RSL because of his companion animal has won a human rights case against the club.
Federal Court judge Brigitte Markovic found Club Jervis Bay discriminated against Vincentia resident Peter Reurich on eight occasions in 2014 and 2015 by not allowing him to enter the club or ride the courtesy bus while in the company of his bearded collie, Boofhead.

"Boofhead, sometimes referred to as 'Boofy' or 'Boof', has been with Mr Reurich since his birth in 2007.
"Mr Reurich feels that Boofhead offers him a freedom that he did not previously have, helps him with his disability and makes it easy for him to get out of the house. When he does not have Boofhead with him, Mr Reurich feels like he is missing something and becomes upset."

According to his psychologist, Tamara Lee, Boofhead helps regulate his emotions and remain comfortable in social settings.
Disputes began between Peter Reurich and RSL staff when he began to bring Boofhead inside.

Justice Markovic described the high level of care given to Boofhead by Mr Reurich.
"Boofhead bathes in the sea every two to four days in summer and every couple of weeks," she said.
"Mr Reurich gives him a bath with detergent. Boofhead attends the vet at least once a year and, as at January 2017, his vaccinations were up to date. Mr Reurich brushes Boofhead regularly and checks him for ticks and other things, like grass seeds, every day."
Catherine Phillips, the founder of non-profit organisation mindDog, said assistance dogs could help people suffering issues such as anxiety, by reading body cues, and remove the handler from the situation causing him or her stress.
Mr Reurich obtained a special trainee licence and jacket for Boofhead so he could be trained to pass a "public access test", the court heard.
"Mr Reurich joined the club on 7 May, 2013, and began to catch the courtesy bus to and from the club," Justice Markovic said.
"As Mr Reurich was new to the area and single, he wanted to make friends and hoped to meet a girlfriend as well as be able to dine there."
But disputes arose between Mr Reurich, who can come across as boisterous and aggressive, and staff when he brought Boofhead inside.
The court heard problems could arise when others questioned the legitimacy of Boofhead, which, in turn, caused Mr Reurich anger and distress.
"Negative reaction to Boofhead can thus be a trigger for Mr Reurich," Justice Markovic said.
The club claimed there was no evidence that Boofhead was trained to do specific things to alleviate the symptoms of Mr Reurich's disability "other than by mere companionship".
Mr Reurich alleged there had been 20 different occasions in which he had been discriminated against on the basis of his disability, eight of which were upheld by Justice Markovic.
They included a club ban, as well as incidents in which he was denied entry to the club, told to leave the premises, and denied being able to ride the courtesy bus.
Justice Markovic ordered the club to pay Mr Reurich $16,000 in compensation, plus interest, for pain and suffering
