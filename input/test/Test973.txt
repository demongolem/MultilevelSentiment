New Delhi, Aug 17 (IBNS) : Activist-politician Swami Agnivesh was manhandled on Friday near the BJP headquarters in Delhi, where he had gone to pay his last respects to former prime minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee, media reports said.
This is the second attack in a month on the 79-year-old social activist, who was beaten in Jharkhand by a mob that allegedly included BJP workers.
"I had gone to pay my respects to Vajpayee ji. Because of the police pickets, I had to walk down the last stretch... suddenly a group of people came and attacked us. There were two-three of us and they were quite a few. They beat us badly, pushed us around, abused us and knocked off my turban," Agnivesh told NDTV on the phone.
"They kept shouting 'he's a traitor, he's a traitor, beat him'," he added.
A mobile phone video taken at the time of the incident, shows Agnivesh being chased, heckled and pushed around by a group. His headgear is yanked by one man and a woman is seen holding her slipper, NDTV reports.
