130 labourers from Odisha stranded in flood-hit Kerala By tweet
Bhubaneswar: As many as 130 labourers from Odisha have been stranded in flood-hit Ernakulam district of Kerala.
The workers, 60 of which hail from Puri, 30 from Cuttack and 40 from Phulbani, were working at a company in Ernakulam. They are reportedly stuck inside a house near a hill in Odkali due to flood.
Lack of food and water in the house has worsened the situation for them. Before their mobile phones ran out of batteries, they telephoned their family members and informed about the situation.
In a video sent by the victims, they have requested the Odisha government to make arrangements for rescuing them
