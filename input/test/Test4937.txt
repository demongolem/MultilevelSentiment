Saturday's Bledisloe Cup opener will cap an immense personal journey for All Blacks captain Kieran Read.
In November last year Read was bed-ridden during the New Zealand's spring tour to Europe, battling chronic pain in his hip brought on by a bulging disc between two vertebrae that was putting pressure on a nerve.

The 109-Test hard man of New Zealand rugby underwent spinal surgery and then six months in rehabilitation before returning for the Crusaders at the end of June.
Standing on North Sydney Oval bathed in late afternoon sun, he could not hide his excitement.
"It's awesome actually. I had a great week with the lads and I can't wait to get back on the field with the boys," he said. Advertisement
"Getting an injury like I had there are a few doubts that do float around but once we got [into] the process of recorery, I'm in a good space now."
Read's return to top-flight rugby is remarkable considering an injury of that kind would have required that he not put any load onto his spine for at least the first three months.

But he returned to Super Rugby having barely missed a beat and, while not at his absolute best just yet, possessed the class to merit an immediate Test call up for the Rugby Championship and a return to the captaincy.
"I always had confidence I'd be back. Probably early on I didn't think it woudl be this quick, so I'm really happy to be here," Read said.
"I'm 100 per cent in terms of running out and playing the game. It's a little bit different in my recovery now and how I do things performance-wise, but out on the track, yep, all good." Loading
The All Blacks will be looking to disrupt any burgeoning self-confidence brewing in the Australian squad and with the likes of Read and second-rower Brodie Retallick returning to the line up they have a good shot at doing so.
Retallick has returned from a chest injury that ruled him out of New Zealand's three-Test series against France in June. Read said neither he nor Retallick, who has played 68 Tests, would be resting on their laurels.
"Experience does count for a lot, in terms of getting into tight situations you've been there, done that, so that's what we've got to us to our advantage," he said.
"What we can't do is just rest on the likes of me or Brodie coming back in and think it's just going to happen for us. We've got to work hard right from the outset, that's across the board, and we've got to go out and try to find our rhythm as quickly as we can.
