Just Added: Top 10 Freshmen Presented By: Micah Abernathy comments on learning Tennessee's new defense Adam Spencer | 6 days ago
The Tennessee Volunteers are undergoing a big change on defense this year, switching from former DC Bob Shoop's 4-3 scheme to new head coach Jeremy Pruitt's 3-4 scheme.
For guys like senior S Micah Abernathy, learning the new defense is an important, but slow, process. As the Vols approach their Week 1 game, Abernathy said the Vols are trying to learn a little bit more of the complex scheme every practice.
Interestingly, he had a strange response when asked whether or not he likes the Vols' new defense ( via 247Sports ):
"I mean, it's not whether you like it more or less," he said.
But, as far as installing the defense goes, Abernathy said it's going pretty well so far:
"We're learning every day, trying to get better," he said. "Getting out there on the field every day, we're just trying to do as much as we can, trying to be more versatile, learning every position we have.
"Learning a new defense, whether it's any type of defense that you're gonna learn, it's gonna be difficult in some areas. Some people are gonna pick it up faster than others. We're just trying to learn every day, learn more and more."
The Vols open the season with a game against a high-powered West Virginia offense, so Pruitt's defense will be put to the test quickly. A 2012 graduate of the University of Missouri, Adam now covers all 14 SEC football teams. Jordan Dajani | 7 hours ag
