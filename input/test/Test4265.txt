Gold futures prices dipped in Friday action, setting the contract on course for a nearly 3% weekly retreat as the metal languishes near a 1 Â½-year low.
Gold found little traction even as the leading dollar index also churned in the red.The dollar, up modestly for the week but surging more than 3% in just the last three months, remains the key driver for the precious metals. A firmer buck, which makes buying gold more expensive to investors using another currency, remains near a roughly 14-month peak.
December gold GCZ8, -0.01% fell $1.20, or less than 0.1%, to $1,183 an ounce. It settled Thursday at $1,184 an ounce, the lowest settlement for a most-active contract since early January of 2017, according to FactSet data.
Gold futures trade down nearly 10% for the year to date, failing to draw the support that might be expected amid geopolitical turmoil around trade war worries and Turkey's financial crisis, as focus remains almost exclusively pinned on the stronger dollar. The precious metal has languished just below the psychologically important $1,200 level after dropping beneath this line more than a year on Monday.
