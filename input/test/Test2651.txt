#HighTrends Why Everybody Is Talking About Divorce Lawyers...The Simple Truth Revealed
If perhaps you have not already, chances are that sometime in your lifetime you will need to seek the services of an attorney at law. Thanks to my interview with Tampa Attorney Christina Mesa, listed here is a group of responses to very common as well as important questions.
1. QUESTION: Do I need to hire an attorney at law in the county where the issue occurs?
ANSWER: No. Many lawyers practice in other counties and other states, depending on their licensure for the latter. Having experience in the county in which the matter will be litigated is important as that attorney will have a comfort level with the county courthouse personnel, attorneys (likely opposing lawyer) and judges. One matter in hiring an attorney away from area wherein the matter occurs is cost of journey time. Some attorneys do not charge for travel, others give you a decreased rate or preserve a billable rate for all work conducted. Talk about that question with each attorney consulted.
2. QUESTION: How am I able to be certain my lawyer is resolving my case?
ANSWER: Every good lawyer accounts for his time (fees) and expenses (costs). Your retainer arrangement should include a confirmation of how the attorney bills his clients - month-to-month, quarterly, etc. You may even track your case in some jurisidictions that provide on-line accessibility to case dockets. If the county has that set up, you're wise to occasionally review the docket and see what activities have transpired by your attorney and the other party/counsel. Also feel comfortable contacting your attorney at intervals to determine the status of the matter, understanding you will likely be charged for these interactions.
3. QUESTION: How do I select an attorney or lawyer?
ANSWER: Legal topics are as vast as those in other sectors, such as medicine, construction, finance, etc. and tend to be just as perplexing. To safeguard your legal rights and remedies, the very best practice is to research your area of need and research what legal professionals are available to help you. A referral from someone you know and regard can add a personal element to the plan to hire an lawyer but should not be the exclusive reason counsel is selected. Research the attorney's background of education, expertise and area(s) of practice. Asking a lot of questions should be urged in this process. Self-help can be empowering but may also limit or negate your recovery. Hiring a law firm should be considered with the exact same degree of thought and consideration as that given to the pick of a medical doctor, accountant, financial expert or therapist.
4. QUESTION: How do I determine if I require a lawyer or attorney?
ANSWER: If you have already been served with a Summons and similar documents (Complaint, Petition, Motion), you really should endeavor to look for legal guidance now. Papers filed in court that begin a lawsuit require responses that involve specific deadlines; missing out on those deadlines could damage your defense, limit or avoid your recovery. Some issues by statute involve a "pre-suit" period that enable you to take into account the legal issues and possible resolution before a lawsuit is filed. Similarly, seeking legal counsel immediately is advised.
5. QUESTION: What is mediation?
ANSWER: Mediation is a process whereby the parties to the issue present at an agreed location with their counsel (if retained) and a selected mediator to try and solve all or some of the concerns involved. Mediators are to be unrelated to all parties and the litigation at issue, are to remain impartial amongst the parties and their counsel, and maintain the confidential structure of the conference to recommend settlement and resolution. Usually the parties share the charge of the mediation equally but other arrangements can be made if all parties are in agreement in advance of the conference. Mediation is usually required in just about every case filed in court and just before a trial is held.
6. QUESTION: What type of legal professional do I need?
ANSWER: Again, like other sectors, attorneys may specialise in a specific or more than one area. Similarly, law offices may specialize, offer general legal needs or offer services in a few precise areas of law. Trial attorneys deal with cases involving lawsuits; family law lawyers handle divorce cases, child custody /visitation, child support, alimony and related matters; general practitioners handle nearly all matters. Some areas of law are extremely specialized, like bankruptcy or taxation; others are delineated by statute, like worker's compensation. Any attorney can go over your specific issue, determine if he or she is qualified to take care of such matters or advise you of the necessity to consult with another in a specialised area
