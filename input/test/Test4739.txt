API Integration AVAYA IP Office 500v2
Integration IP Office 500v2
I need incoming / outgoing calls in Avaya IP Office (data) to be sent in real time to my database.
Also, I want to include the in the API the path to the recording file of the call -- if possible.
1- Once the phone rings, you call a RESTful POST / GET Web Serice API to pass:
INCIDENT_ID -- I suppose that Avaya generates an ID for each call.
COUNTRY_CODE
CALL_TIME (The exact time of receiving the call)
PBX_ID (Hardcoded Value)
DOMAIN-URL/[INCIDENT_ID}/{COUNTRY_CODE}/{CALLER_ID}/{CALLED_DID}/{EXTENSION}/{CALL_TIME}/{PBX_ID}
2- Once the phone is Picked Up, you pass:
INCIDENT_ID
EXTENSION --- that picked up the call
CALL_TIME (The exact time of receiving the call)
PICKUP_TIME
3- Once the phone is Dropped you pass:
CALL_TYPE ( IN / OUT)
CALL_DURATION (in seconds) --- I suppose you pass 0 in case the call was missed.
RECORDING_FILE_PATH. (In case the recording is set up.)
PBX_ID (Hardcoded Value)
We need to discuss the options of:
The call is answered by the Auto Reply msg.
The call is forwarded.
The call reaches a DID that has a rule to Auto forward to a mobile phone number. (Usually after working hours / holidays)
Pls, let me know if you have any question or any suggestion to enhance the flow or any point that you think I missed.
