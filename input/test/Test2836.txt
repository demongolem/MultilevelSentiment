So, people who do not exercise on a regular basis can feel less energetic often. 2. Overthinking
There are times in most people's lives wherein, they have to give a certain matter a lot of thought, in order to be able to make the right decisions, which is completely normal. However, some people tend to think a lot, or overthink every little situation that happens on a daily basis. Overthinking causes stress and stress, in turn, increases the cortisol hormone level in the body, which can eventually harm your energy levels. 3. Skipping Breakfast
