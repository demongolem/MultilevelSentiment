Twitter How To Be Interesting Hey, Matt Morris. I am from MattMorris.com, coming to you from Bali. I am in the rice field actually, the terraced rice field, very very cool. Now, most of you are in Network Marketing if you watch my video, so this, my friend, is what you call multilevel . Awesome awesome view and man just what a fascinating day went whitewater rafting and just having such an amazing time getting to know the culture and, you know, exploring sea and the world I am always so interested to, you know, see what the world has offered, you know, so many people unfortunately they just stay in their little area, you know, they stay in their country, they might adventure out one or two countries but very few people actually get to see the world and that's one the beautiful beautiful things about. The network marketing profession not only you can develop financial freedom you can also develop the time freedom. So, literally travel all over the world, whenever you want, stay as long as you want, spend as money as you want, I mean it's just so amazing amazing amazing. So I thought you would show here since I am so interested and, you know, the country here and because the show want to do here how to be interesting, so how do you be interesting? And it's one of the things and you know being able to prospect people and developer poor and develop friendship is you just want to be an interesting person, right? And so here is the best way to be interesting is to be interested, be interested in other people, be interested in the world, be interested in other culture, be interested in other religions. Don't be so close minded you know we kind of grow up in our area, we have our religion, we have our food, we have our culture and we tend to think you know our way is the best way but you know when you can be interested, truly truly interested in the world and mainly in other people and then all of a sudden you become very interesting. So that's it. If you want to be interesting be interested and my wish for you is you go out and do whatever it takes, go out and pay the price, go out and do the work, do whatever it takes the live. This is kind of life style because I can promise you it is just so incredibly worth it.
