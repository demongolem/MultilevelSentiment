Weekly News Briefs
Australia : Exemptions to Labor Market Testing Requirements Unchanged â€“ The Australian Government has confirmed that exemptions to Labor Market Testing (LMT) requirements will remain unchanged for Temporary Skill Shortage (TSS) Visas. Interim exemptions that have been in place since March 2018 will remain available under the new regulations that took effect on August 12, 2018 .
A Temporary Skill Shortage (TSS) nomination application is exempt from job advertising where: The nominee is an intra-corporate transferee, being assigned to an Australian business from an associated entity overseas; The nomination application is required only due to: A change in corporate structure; or A change in the nominee's guaranteed annual earnings (notably, a nomination for a change in occupation does require LMT); The nominee has an internationally recognized record of outstanding achievement in academia, research, sport, or as a top-talent chef; The nominated position attracts a base salary of at least AUD 250,000; or The nominated occupation is one of the following: A medical occupation with ANZSCO code 253XXX (but not 253111 General Medical Practitioner or 253999 Medical Practitioners Not Elsewhere Classified); A paramedic occupation with ANZSCO code 4111XX.
These exemptions are in addition to those that arise from Australia's commitments under various free trade agreements, as well as the World Trade Organization General Agreement on Trade in Services. These include exemptions based on the visa applicant's nationality, the jurisdiction from which the visa applicant is making an intra-corporate transfer and the nature of the visa applicant's proposed role in Australia.
Canada : CBSA Reduces Hours at Land Borders as it Officially Launches its Pilot "Flagpoling Program" â€“ The Canada Border Services Agency (CBSA) has reduced the hours during which it will accept certain applications from individuals in Canada, as it officially launches its pilot "Flagpoling Program" at some of the busiest border crossings in Ontario and Quebec. Originally announced in June 2017 , the Flagpoling Program aims to reduce the number of requests the CBSA receives at U.S. land border ports of entry from applicants who are already physically present in Canada, as opposed to those submitting applications to an in-Canada processing center. As a result, in-Canada applicants will have more limited access to process their work, study or visitor applications or to finalize their Permanent Residence process at a land border. In general, application processing times vary based on application type, and individuals in Canada should apply well in advance of their expiry or travel date.
The CSBA's reduced operating hours are: Ontario: Fort Erie (Peace Bridge), Niagara-on-the-Lake (Queenston-Lewiston Bridge) or Niagara Falls (Rainbow Bridge) ports of entry as follows: Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday from 8:00 a.m. to midnight. Quebec: St-Bernard-de-Lacolle and St-Armand/Philipsburg as follows: Monday to Thursday, from noon to 7:00 p.m.; Saturday, from 9:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m.
New Zealand : Additional Expiry Period for Interim Visas â€“ Starting August 27, 2018, Interim Visas issued by Immigration New Zealand (INZ) will expire 21 days after the temporary visa application is declined or withdrawn. Previously, these visas expired either when a decision was made or after six months if no decision had been made. An Interim Visa is granted to visa holders in New Zealand who have visas that are about to expire and have lodged a further temporary visa application. It is granted automatically while their application is being assessed.
New Zealand : Online Applications for Dependents â€“ Partners and dependent children who enter New Zealand with or after the primary applicant can now apply online for a visitor, student, work or resident visa based on the immigration status of a sponsoring family member who is either a NZ citizen, a NZ visa holder or a NZ visa applicant. The online system was available for primary applicants and has now been expanded. Applicants can upload application documents to an online portal instead of the previous requirement to send original documents. This decreases the processing time for dependents' visa applications.
New Zealand : E-Visas Now Issued Instead of Passport Labels for Visas â€“ Effective July 4, 2018, Immigration New Zealand (INZ) is issuing e-visas that travellers must now print out and bring to the port of exit when travelling to New Zealand. INZ no longer issues physical visa labels.
Panama : Tourist Visa Exemption Expanded â€“ Effective immediately, Panama has expanded the tourist visa exemption to those currently holding a residence permit or a valid multiple-entry visa from Japan, Korea, Singapore or any EU Member State. This list adds to the original rule, which allowed foreign nationals with a valid visa from a Schengen country, Australia, Canada, the United Kingdom or the United States to enter as a tourist without a visa. The updated rule also reduces the required validity period of the qualifying visa from the origin country; it must now only be valid for six months instead of one year. The previous rule requiring use of the visa at least once in the issuing country continues to apply.
Portugal : Visa Validity to Match Assignment Duration â€“ In a change of policy , consular and immigration officials are now issuing visas with a validity matching the underlying assignment duration. Foreign nationals should benefit from no longer having to obtain a visa renewal or temporary residence permit for short assignments.
Russia : No Retroactive Effect for Change of Residence Registration Rules â€“ Russian authorities have confirmed that foreign nationals legally registered under the previous residence registration policy do not have to change their registration to comply with the new rule , which requires the landlord (e.g. the accommodation provider) to register on behalf of the foreign national. Additionally, authorities have confirmed that foreign nationals are authorized to complete registration themselves if their landlord is unable to complete registration due to a business trip, hospitalization, residence abroad or similar reason, and if the reason can be documented. Applicants should check with their local migration office before attempting to register themselves as not all local divisions will honor these exceptions.
Slovak Republic : Delays at Slovak Embassy in India â€“ The Embassy of the Slovak Republic in New Delhi, India has reported an appointment delay of one month for visa applications and up to seven months for residence permit applications. This affects all visa nationals applying for a visa for Slovakia through India, as well as visa-exempt nationals and visa nationals seeking an EU ICT Permit or Single Permit application for Slovakia through India. Visa-exempt nationals and visa nationals with a long-term residence status in another country than India may be able to file their application elsewhere. Fragomen will work with affected applicants to minimize delays. Fragomen expects that the current Slovak delay may be a spillover effect from prior delays for the Czech Republic and Germany , with employers seeking alternate locations to employ their foreign workforce.
Turkey : Adjudication Delay Increased â€“ Turkish officials have unofficially conveyed that delays in residence permit processing as a result of additional processing at the main Migration Directorate office in Vatan have increased to two to three months from filing, up from four weeks. Fragomen will continue to work with affected employers and foreign nationals to seek case-specific solutions to alleviate the delays.
Venezuela : Additional Documents Required for 90-Day TR-L Visa Applications â€“ Effective August 14, 2018, the Venezuelan Immigration Office (SAIME) requires all foreign nationals applying for a 90 Day TR-L visa to include the following additional documents with their application package: Foreign national's CV in Spanish; and Company letter printed on company letterhead with stamp and signature from the legal representative, detailing the exact activities to be performed in Venezuela, the exact length of the visit and the address where the foreign national will stay during the visit to Venezuela.
This change is due to political changes in the country and it is not clear if this affects all or some nationals. Applicants should work with their immigration provider to determine the best course of action.
