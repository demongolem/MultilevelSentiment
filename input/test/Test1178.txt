Serena Williams: 'I want to be perfect as mum, but everyone makes mistakes' AUGUST 17, 2018 11:10 Serena Williams
Serena Williams shared a long post on Instagram to admit she wasn't a good mum. Commenting on her choice to openly speak about private problems, Serena said: ' I think it's really important to just, first of all, whether it's publicly or not, just to talk about it to someone. This is a whole new position that I'm in. I have been through a lot of stuff in my life, but I have never been through this, having a baby and feeling with the emotions and the ups and downs and the fears and the excitement, quite frankly. I just love talking about it, because I feel like a lot of people have those same emotions and they don't have the same platform as I have. And mostly I want women out there to know that if I'm going through it and I know you're going through it, then we're in this together. Everyone, no matter who we are, kind of always have the same feelings .'
Andy Murray has been a vocal supporter of women's tennis the past several years. What has it meant to you to have him speaking out, showing support? ' Yeah, he has been such a great supporter for women, especially women's tennis. I really think he's a great guy. He really just is connected and understands the future and the world and life. He's really in sync with that. It's been really great to have his support.'
Serena is known for really having such high expectations of herself and being a perfectionist in tennis. It clearly translate into mom and life and everything else. How do you kind of give yourself a break and a breather to know that no one is perfect, something new, especially being a mom? 'It can be overwhelming, and I tend to be a perfectionist, and I like to do things at the standard that is maybe unrealistic, and that includes being a mom. So it's hard. Every day is a struggle for me in just terms of being regular and letting go and realizing that I'm not going to be a perfectionist at this. I'm going to make mistakes and that's okay, because everyone makes mistakes. It's just something I'm still going and learning.
