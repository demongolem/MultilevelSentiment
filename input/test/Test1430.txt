countries<br />, was not included.<br />For purposes of the study, a standard alcoholic drink was defined as 10 grams or approximately 12 milliliters of alcohol. That measurement varies around the world; for example, a standard drink is 8 grams in the UK and 14 grams in US. It's<br />even higher<br />in Italy, Portugal and Spain.<br />Over 1,300 studies on alcohol use by country and the accompanying disease burden, measured by both deaths and disability-adjusted life years, were analyzed by the Global Burden of Disease collaborators.<br />For the first time, Gakidou said, in an attempt to improve on previous research, the new analysis adjusted for the impact of tourism on local statistics in liquor sales and attempted to control for unrecorded drinking, such as home brewing or illicit trade. Another improvement over past studies, she said, was a new meta-analysis of the effects of alcohol on the 23 health outcomes, which was then used to access risk.<br />In independent comments published alongside the study, King's College London alcohol researcher Robyn Burton called the study "state-of-the-art."<br />"The conclusions of the study are clear and unambiguous: alcohol is a colossal global health issue," Burton wrote, suggesting that policy makers put a priority on programs that focus on decreasing alcohol consumption.<br />However, the Alcohol Information Partnership, a group comprising eight of the world's biggest liquor companies, said in a statement that "Nothing in this study challenges the array of studies suggesting that choosing to drink moderately is associated with a decreased risk of some health issues and a lower risk of death. We advocate sensible drinking by those who choose to drink and support consistent, evidence-based advice, which enables people to make their own informed choices about alcohol."<br />Globally, the study found that about 2.4 billion people drink alcohol. Twenty-five percent are women, who consumed 0.73 drinks each day. Thirty-nine percent are men, who drink an average of 1.7 drinks a day.<br />The countries with the highest percentage of men and women who reported drinking in the previous year were Denmark, Norway and Germany. Although they didn't make the top 10, 85.3% of men and 81.3% of women in the UK said they had tippled in the previous 12 months. In the US, 68.8% of men and 56.8% of women said they had done so.<br />Countries with the lowest percentage of drinking citizens were<br />typically Arab and Middle Eastern nations.<br />What drinking alcohol means for your cancer and death risk<br />For ages 50 and up, cancers were the leading cause of alcohol-related deaths; road injuries, self-harm and tuberculosis were the top causes of death around the world in the 15-to-49 age group.<br />However, in terms of total numbers, Gakidou said, "most deaths from alcohol come from cardiovascular disease and cancers when you look at average consumption by age and sex within countries."<br />Potential benefits outweighed by overall risk<br />The results appear to fly in the face of<br /
