Paul Ince: Paul Pogba has been a "nightmare" since the World Cup 17, 2018
Paul Ince has hit out at Paul Pogba's behaviour since the World Cup, describing the Frenchman as a "nightmare".
The midfielder was reportedly upset with Jose Mourinho's comments on his performances at the finals, in which the manager intimated that he wasn't focused enough at Manchester United.
When asked whether he was happy at the club following Man United's win over Leicester, Pogba said: "There are things I cannot say, otherwise I will get fined."
Speaking to Paddy Power, Ince was quick to jump on the media bandwagon and lay into Pogba, who he believes has "too much to say".
"Since he's come back, he's been a nightmare, As a player, irrespective of whether you're happy or unhappy, there are ways to conduct yourself," he said.
"He captained United in their opening game of the season against Leicester, played brilliantly, and then came out with those quotes afterwards. I really can't understand why he'd do that other than to get attention and set tongues wagging.
"Paul Pogba has got too much to say. Mourinho made him captain last week, which is a huge honour and one which he seems to underestimate. If Jose really thought so little of him, I doubt he'd have given him the armband."
Much is made of Pogba's attitude, of his lifestyle and demeanour and feelings towards his manager. There is probably some friction with the boss, which is totally normal, only magnified when the story centres around him.
But here are the facts: Pogba won the World Cup with France, became a leader in the dressing room, returned to training early, came into the starting XI as captain after just three days of training and was United's most influential player by a mile, scoring from the spot and then controlling the midfield.
That, to me, hardly constitutes a "nightmare"
