Emjay Lapus in Movies/TV BAKWIT BOYS Become Larger Than Life This August
One of the most anticipated entries in the Pista (PPP) 2018 is the John Paul Laxamana-helmed .
The film chronicles the tale of the Datul brothersâ€“The eldest brother, Elias (Vance Larena), is the band vocalist together with the youngest, Sonny (Mackie Empuerto), while Joey (Ryle Santiago) plays the guitar and Philip (Nikko Natividad) composes their songs.
After a supertyphoon ravages their hometown and puts a halt to their musical pursuits, the brothers are forced to move from Isabela all the way to Pampanga to stay with their grandfather. While taking refuge in this distant farmland, the brothers put their musical talents to good use and perform their original song in a town fiesta to earn some cash.
Their performance impresses Rose (Devon Seron), a rich city girl who is passionate for music. She offers to help the boys record their songs and have them played on the radio. Individual interests and personal conflicts test the unity of the band, as they struggle to make sense of life's ironies and tragedies.
Speaking about the inspiration behind the film, Laxamana drew from his experiences while collaborating with musicians from different parts of the country. "We compose original songs which we release online and submit to local radio stations for possible airplay," says Laxamana. "Because local radio stations mostly prefer to play songs by Manila-based celebrities, sharing the music we create to a wider audience has always been a challenge. This aspect of my life was what inspired me to make Bakwit Boys and tap my Tarlac-based musician friend to create the original songs for it." Another inspiration behind the film is Laxamana's experience in the wake of the 1991 Mt. Pinatubo eruption. " Bakwit Boys is also a story about moving on and rising from the wreckage brought about by catastrophes, both natural and manmade."
Bakwit Boys runs from August 15 to 21 in cinemas nationwide as part .
