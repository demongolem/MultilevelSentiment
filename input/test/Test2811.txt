 COMMENT EMAIL MORE Look no further than the super-sized Livingston County/Genesee Region league for the big boys of area small high school football.
Hornell won a 13th Section V championships last season, the 40th that area teams were crowned. The Red Raiders edged fellow league member Livonia , 22-20, in the Section V Class B final.
The gain for Hornell stopped a three-year string of sectional titles by Batavia . The Batavia Blue Devils are a new member of the 22-team league and the pick for No. 1 in the season's first Democrat and Chronicle Section V High School Coaches' Small-School Coaches Poll.

"There had been talks last year and even the year before," Batavia coach Brennan Briggs said. "It almost happened last year, but there was no room for us.
"Our modified and JVs have been playing a Livingston County/Genesee schedule. We've been battling each other in Class B (during sectionals). It's nice that we are going to see them during the season. Plus, Bath is already a good test. They play physical football."
Batavia has welcomed back eight players in last season's starting lineup on offense and seven on defense, including two-time Democrat and Chronicle All-Greater Rochester selection Ray Leach . Leach was injured after being stabbed earlier this month.
If Leach is eligible and healthy enough to play, it may not always be easy to find the senior in Batavia's formations.

"Don't be surprised to see him throw a couple of passes," Briggs said. "We will have wildcat stuff going on with Ray. He may move all over the field, because he's so hard to defend."
 The top three positions in the coaches' poll/rankings may be fluid early.
Hornell plays at Batavia in both team's season-opener, Aug. 31. Batavia plays at Livonia on Sept. 7.
