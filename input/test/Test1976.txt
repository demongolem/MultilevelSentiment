An Australian teenager has pleaded guilty to hacking into Apple's secure central computer network.
The boy, 16, from Melbourne city, broke into the American company's mainframe from his suburban home many times over a year, The Age newspaper reported, citing statements made in court by the teenager's lawyer.
The teen downloaded 90 gigabytes of secure files and accessed customer accounts without exposing his identity.
When Apple became aware of the intrusion it contacted the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation, which referred the matter to the Australian Federal Police (AFP). The unnamed hacker was said to be an Apple fan (Source: AFP)
A raid on the boy's family home produced two laptops, a mobile phone and a hard drive which matched the intrusion reported by Apple.
The sensitive documents were saved in a folder called 'hacky hack hack,' the report added.
The boy also believed to have boasted about his activities on the mobile messaging service WhatsApp.
His name could not be made public and he will be sentenced next month. Advertisemen
