By Associated Press August 17 at 6:43 AM BERLIN â€” Austria's asylum authority says it has disciplined an employee and regrets "linguistic lapses" on his part following a cliche-ridden decision in which an Afghan man's application for asylum on the grounds of his homosexuality was reportedly rejected.
Austrian magazine Falter reported this week that an official in Lower Austria province rejected the man's application with the words: "Neither the way you walk, nor your behavior, nor your clothes even slightly suggested that you might be homosexual." It said the man appealed the decision.
Without addressing details of the case, the Federal Office for Foreigners and Asylum said Friday an internal review was conducted in May following complaints and the official's authority to sign decisions was revoked. It said he had made decisions that weren't up to standard in terms of formulation.
