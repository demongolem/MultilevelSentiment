'You'll never race again' RELATED Dale Earnhardt Jr.'s wife Amy gives birth to baby girl
"The doctor told me that I would never race again," he said.
After getting other medical opinions, he still races eight years and hundreds of events later. The 25-year-old from Bakersfield, Calif. has two wins in the Nascar Xfinity Series and has placed in the top five twice in 2018.
"At first I didn't think I would be back in a race car, and I didn't know anything about diabetes, so I assumed that information I got was correct," Reed said. "But from there I did a lot of research on athletes with diabetes and found an endocrinologist -- which is a diabetes specialist -- that had worked with a lot of athletes."
Reed still works with Dr. Anne Peters.
"She has been a big realization for me," Reed said. "No. 1: I can do whatever I want in life, despite having diabetes. No. 2: working with your doctor is just so so important to having success with managing your diabetes." A post shared by Conor Daly (@conordaly22) on Jul 25, 2018 at 1:04pm PDT
Daly, 26, was diagnosed when he was 14, but was never told he had to stop racing. The Indiana native has reached the podium once during his Verizon IndyCar Series career.
"My parents were certainly worried," he said. "Just because we didn't know. We didn't know what life would be like with diabetes. We didn't know what it was gonna take. We didn't know how I could keep going."
"I just thought about it in my own head that it was never going to stop me."
Daly said he was back in a go-cart just days after getting out of the hospital.
"I just kept on learning from there," he said. "Everyday I learn something new. Everyday I try to continue to live a healthier lifestyle and control my blood sugar consistently and here I am today many, many years later, many Indianapolis 500s later and now getting ready for my first ever Nascar race. So I'm still sort of accomplishing my goals that I've always wanted to accomplish."
Safety is our No. 1 priority
While the drivers acknowledge that passing out is something that could "technically" happen as a worst-case scenario, they have practiced and prepared to ensure their safety and the safety of other drivers.
"At the end of the day, the No. 1 priority is safety," Reed said. "So if something were to fail or malfunction and we didn't know what our blood sugar was ... and I couldn't for some reason adjust like I needed to, to make the adjustment, whatever the case may be, you just stop racing. You pull in the pit until you can get the issue resolved.
"It's no different than if I was behind the wheel of my street car. If my blood sugar wasn't where it needed to be, safe and where I know I should be, with my blood sugar or my monitoring system, then I don't put myself in that position."
Like many other race car drivers, Reed uses cycling and weightlifting to maintain strength while he isn't in the car. Both drivers have to be cleared by doctors for their respective series. If their in-car glucose monitoring systems show low levels, they can also consume a drink high in sugar and carbohydrates. A post shared by Conor Daly (@conordaly22) on Jun 28, 2018 at 4:44pm PDT
"This gives me the opportunity to just share my story," Daly said. "I've been living with diabetes for 12 years now and it's something that a lot of people might not know. I've had obviously a long racing career but never really put it too much in the spotlight about when I was diagnosed with Type 1 diabetes at age 14.
"It's really cool to be able to tell people a little bit about how I've been dealing with it and how I've made it to where I am now and kind of inspire people, if that's possible." ( 0 ) Leave a commen
