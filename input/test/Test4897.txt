Hamas' moment of truth Optimistic media reports about far-reaching â€Žagreements with Hamas in the Gaza Strip , meant to â€Žensure peace and quiet on the border, are premature. â€ŽAs of now, the only understanding in place is that â€ŽFriday will pose a significant test for Gaza's â€Žrulers, who have yet to shelve their border riot â€Žcampaign, and only it the day proves to be incident-â€Žfree will it be possible to go ahead with the â€Žnegotiations. â€Ž
It is not that nothing is happening behind the â€Žscenes. Several mediators, headed by Egyptian â€Žintelligence officials and U.N. Middle East envoy â€ŽNickolay Mladenov, are holding intense talks between â€ŽPalestinian and Israeli officials in an effort to â€Žbroker a long-term cease-fire, and the U.S., Russia â€Žand several Persian Gulf states are also involved, â€Žat one level or another.â€Ž
Israel's primary stipulation has always been â€Žcomplete calm on the border. Hamas agreed to that â€Žlast week, following the latest flare-up, and seeing â€Žthat the deal was holding, Israel lived up to its â€Žword, resumed operations at the Kerem Shalom cargo â€Žcrossing and expanded the fishing zone â€Žoff Gaza's coast from 6 to 9 nautical miles. â€Ž
This was phase one of mutual gestures, and it gave â€Žthe south the calmest week it has seen since March â€Žâ€Ž30. â€Ž
Much of phase two depends on this Friday's border â€Žprotest. Over the past four months, border protests â€Žhave attracted thousands of Palestinian and have â€Žconsistently turned into mass riots that include â€Žattempts to breach the security fence alongside â€Žburning tires, hurling stones and firebombs at â€ŽIsraeli troops and sending incendiary kites and â€Žballoon over the border, where they have wreaked â€Žhavoc on Israeli communities. â€Ž
Hamas has pledged to ensure this Friday's protest â€Žwould indeed be quiet, but if anything, this will be â€Ža test of its leadership and its ability to hold â€Žboth the masses and the rogue terrorist group in â€ŽGaza at bay. â€Ž
The Palestinian interest in maintaining calm â€Žstems from another reason: Next week they mark the â€ŽEid al-Adha holiday and they would undoubtedly prefer â€Žcelebrating it airstrike-free. Israel and Egypt may even â€Žoffer additional gestures for the holiday as â€Žconfidence-building moves between the parties.â€Ž
If the calm does prevail in the coming days, truce â€Žtalks will continue and they will probably be delved â€Žinto more serious issues, such as Gaza's energy, â€Žwater, sewage and wages problems.â€Ž
This phase will require making some serious â€Ždecision, such as whether the Palestinian Authority â€Žwill be part of a potential Israel-Hamas deal â€“ in â€Žother words, are Israel and the world going to â€Žofficially recognize Hamas as the sovereign in Gaza; â€Žwhether the deal would include a mere truce or be a â€Žbroader "rehabilitation for disarmament" agreement â€Žand, of course, whether it will include a prisoner â€Žexchange deal. â€Ž
One must remember, however, that none of the â€Žunderstandings reach so far between Israel and Hamas â€Žhave even been put on paper. Media reports â€Žsuggesting otherwise are premature and it would take â€Ždays, if not weeks, of calm on the border before the â€Žnegotiations can address practical measures on the â€Žground. Even then, there would still be numerous hurdles to â€Žcross. â€Ž
While we have to wait and see how things develop, â€Žfor not, at least, we can say that the mediators â€Žhave been able to broker a clam and avoid war.â€Ž
