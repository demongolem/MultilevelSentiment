All News > Global Medical connectors Market By Manufacturers, Type And Application, Regions, Forecast To 2023 Global Medical connectors Market By Manufacturers, Type And Application, Regions, Forecast To 2023 mandar Medical Connector Market, By Material (Metal, Plastic) By Region - Global Forecast 2023 Market Scenario: Medical connectors are used to interconnect different medical electronic equipment, such as diagnostic devices, surgical instruments, therapy applications, surgery assist devices, and disposable equipment with one another. The global medical connector market is projected to expand at a CAGR of 8 % between the forecast period of 2017 and 2023. Market Dynamics: Growing Adoption Of Medical Devices Is The Critical Determinant Of The Market There has been an explosive adoption of medical electronics and electrical systems such as Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), ultrasound, defibrillators, electrocardiography, heart-lung machines, surgical, diagnostic and therapy systems, to name a few. The growth in adoption of medical electronics and electrical systems is in direct correlation with the increase in demand for medical connectors. Adoption of ultrasound, which need high numbers of mating, cycles is another driver of the market. Custom Designed And Refurbishing Of Medical Devices Coupled With Growing Demand Of Sterilizable, Reusable And Disposable Medical Connectors Is Driving A Significant Demand Growing adoption of in situ diagnostic and surgical devices is driving a tremendous demand for sterilizable, reusable, hybrids, and cost-effective disposable medical connectors. The growing customization of devices to meet specific application requirements is another driver of the market. There is a significant demand for medical connectors with low-friction coatings such as silicon. Other market trends include watertight sealing, autoclavable, and surviving temperatures above 121Â° C for 20 minutes. Another development has been the demand for antimicrobial-coated connectors to meet FDA standards. WHO estimates that 8.7% of hospital patients had nosocomial infections affecting over 1.4 million people worldwide. The US government will start penalizing hospitals in 2017 under the Readmissions Reduction Program (HRRP) of the Affordable Care Act, for hospital-acquired infection. This development is expected to be the most active driver for the U.S. market.
