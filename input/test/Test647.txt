Stick or twist? Big decisions ahead for Sarri and Emery
Some coaches make adjustments to suit the tools available, others rigidly stick to long-held principles. Early evidence suggests Maurizio Sarri and Unai Emery prefer the second method by asking their new charges to buy into tactics that, to begin with, might not totally suit.
Take Emery at Arsenal and his insistence on playing out from the back, even when facing a high-pressing team like Manchester City. It didn't look like Petr Cech was too keen on that last week. And I'd always be nervous about Shkodran Mustafi receiving the ball on the edge of his box.
Then there's the new manager's liking for getting his attackers to aggressively close down. Can Mesut Ozil and Henrikh Mkhitaryan, for instance, do that in the way Carlos Bacca and Kevin Gameiro did so successfully for Emery at Sevilla? Photo: AFP /Getty Images
Ozil, for one, could turn into a major problem. After being awarded a ludicrously lucrative contract last season, the languid German almost demands inclusion. That's fine when he's in the mood, pulling the strings with that wonderful eye for an opening. It won't sit so comfortably if his passing gets sloppy, as it did against City, and he drifts to the edges of a contest. Chelsea vs Arsenal | Preview | TV | Live stream | Odds
Over at Stamford Bridge, meanwhile, Sarri has quickly ditched the five-man defence that helped Chelsea win the title in 2017 after Antonio Conte famously switched to that system when the other fell flat. As a result, Sarri must now figure out the central defenders best suited to a back four. David Luiz, I'd say, will be hard pressed to make a convincing case, despite cruising through the cushy win at Huddersfield.
But going into tomorrow evening's tasty London derby, you would have to give Chelsea the edge, largely because a winning mentality still survives, despite last term's sharp drop in standards. On top, new signing Jorginho looks capable of improving a midfield previously short on balance.
And as long as Real Madrid don't react to their Super Cup defeat to Atletico Madrid on Wednesday by making an offer Chelsea can't refuse, Eden Hazard should still be around this season to add the kind of match-winning class that has seen off Arsenal before.

One of many challenges facing Emery is instilling steel and grit into a dressing room that had grown a bit soft. The uncompromising Basque clearly recognised that, hence the swift acquisition of Lucas Torreira, the tough little ball winner who must surely start to give Arsenal a chance of competing in midfield.
So many questions, so much work to do for two managers unfamiliar with the Premier League's demands. Even the great Pep Guardiola got caught unawares by the unrelenting heat. Only by experiencing it for themselves can Sarri and Emery make informed decisions about what's required. Tottenham vs Fulham
It's important that stadium delays don't affect Spurs
It hasn't been a great week for Spurs. The delay to the new stadium has taken some shine off that opening win at Newcastle. The uncertainty involved can't help but affect a team that would have dearly loved to have avoided any kind of return to Wembley, never mind this extended one.
For the team and manager, negotiating this period could well define their season. Mauricio Pochettino's boys simply cannot afford to be conceding ground at this early stage, seeing as competition for a top-four spot looks fiercer than ever. Photo: Action Images via Reuters
More bad news comes in the shape of the calendar. It's still August, which means Harry Kane obviously won't score against Fulham. Only joking, of course.
That surprising record of never having notched in this opening month surely can't last much longer. Tottenham's top man must be desperate to get going. Tottenham vs Fulham | Preview | TV | Live stream | Odds
I do wonder about Kane, though. He looked a bit jaded at St James' Park, lacking his normal zip, just as he did as the World Cup progressed.
You do have to ask if he has enjoyed a long enough break to refresh body and mind. I mean, he's only human. Plus, a new baby in the house won't be doing much for his sleep.
With all that in mind, it's a good job Dele Alli looked in fine shape last week, not just grabbing a goal but causing all sorts of problems with his clever movement.
It's easy to forget that Alli is still young, still learning his trade in the top flight. Watching him perform from Sky's commentary gantry, I couldn't help but feel he's in for a good season. You would certainly think he'll feature heavily in Slavisa Jokanovic's pre-match team talk as Fulham look for ways to get something from this game.
Fulham's home defeat to Crystal Palace must have been deflating, not to say a sharp reminder of the stiff task ahead.
With so many arrivals at Craven Cottage, it might be a month or two before things settle down and the team starts to take shape. In the meantime, they've got to hang in there. West Ham vs Bournemouth
Cherries give West Ham's strangers the chance to become better acquainted
Well, it can only get better. A little easier, too. Manuel Pellegrini must have had nightmares this week thinking about the goals his new team conceded in that drubbing by Liverpool. West Ham vs Bournemouth | Preview | TV | Live stream | Odds
With five players making their full debuts, this did indeed look like a team of strangers, especially when trying to hold a shaky defensive line. Not only that, Pellegrini's decision to use Declan Rice in midfield badly backfired. Dragged off at half-time, I hope this promising young defender can quickly bounce back.
Come kick-off Saturday, though, all that negativity will have been pushed to the margins in favour of excitement generated by the recruitment of players like Jack Wilshere, Andriy Yarmolenko and Felipe Anderson. Liverpool are one thing, Bournemouth quite another.
A packed London Stadium will be demanding much more from this new-look team.
Yet, Eddie Howe's side played really well in seeing off Cardiff last week. With the lively Ryan Fraser (below) leading the charge, their pace in attack proved a little too much for Neil Warnock's newly-promoted lot. Photo: Reuters/Dylan Martinez
For Pellegrini, then, it is about picking the best team for an occasion when the pressure is on. If he gets it right, an arena rife with discord last term can turn into a much more enjoyable place to play football.
No doubt about it, the Hammers look in a much better place now. They just have to prove it with some solid displays. The season starts now in London E20. Burnley vs Watford
Turf Moor trip will prove proper test
Before a ball had been kicked, I tipped Watford for the drop. It was based on a hunch their manager, Javi Gracia, would not make it to Christmas and then the team would fail to clamber out of trouble.
I might be completely wrong here. It certainly wouldn't be the first time. And their opening-day defeat of Brighton contradicted such doubts when Roberto Pereyra, with two fine goals, showcased the talent at Vicarage Road.
Still, my mind won't be changed just yet. Quite often, a team nobody expects to struggle gets sucked into the mire, sometimes fatally so. Stoke were the latest to sadly succumb. Burnley vs Watford | Preview | TV | Live stream | Odds
And trips to Turf Moor are always a good barometer of a team's togetherness and fighting spirit. Don't get me wrong, Burnley should find things a lot harder this season, especially if they progress in the Europa League. I'd be amazed if the Clarets got anywhere near last season's heroics in finishing seventh.
Even so, Sean Dyche's side, with Joe Hart in goal, have already shown they understand the value of a clean sheet. Breaking them down on Sunday won't be easy at all.
In this respect, Troy Deeney feels he can forge a useful strike partnership with Andre Gray following a decent start in that Brighton win.
Whether Gracia agrees is another matter entirely. The Spaniard hasn't always appeared to be Deeney's biggest fan.
Still, this one could be tight, whoever plays up front
