This multi-center randomized and controlled trial was led by<br />William Tettelbach<br />, MD, principal investigator and former Executive System Medical Director of Wound Care and Hyperbaric Medicine Services for InterMountain Healthcare. Dr. Tettelbach is now Associate Chief Medical Officer for MiMedx, a position that postdated the completion of the study.<br />Clinical Study Design and Results<br />The objective of the study was to determine the safety and effectiveness of EpiFix as compared to standard of care (SOC) therapy for the treatment of non-healing DFUs. The primary efficacy endpoint was the incidence of complete wound closure over a 12-week period. Data from 110 patients meeting study inclusion and exclusion criteria were analyzed in the Intent-to-Treat (ITT) cohort. A total of 98 patients completed the study Per Protocol (Per-Protocol cohort).<br />ITT analysis requires patients to be included even if they did not fully adhere to the protocol. In comparison, in a Per-Protocol analysis, only patients who completed the entire clinical trial according to the protocol are counted towards the final results.<br />In the current study on an ITT basis, 70% of patients who received weekly EpiFix had complete healing by 12 weeks versus 50% of patients only receiving weekly SOC (EpiFix 70% vs. SOC 50%, p=0.0338).<br />For patients completing the study per protocol, 81% of those who received weekly EpiFix treatments achieved complete healing by 12 weeks. In comparison, 55% of patients had complete healing in 12 weeks after receiving weekly SOC alone (EpiFix + SOC 81% vs. SOC 55%, p=0.0093).<br />In the ITT cohort, adjusting for co-variates associated with healing, Cox regression analysis showed patients treated with EpiFix were more than twice as likely to heal completely within 12 weeks as those not receiving EpiFix  (HR: 2.15, 95% confidence interval 1.30-3.57, p=0.003).<br />Mechanism of Action<br />EpiFixÂ® is a tissue matrix allograft composed of dehydrated human amnion/chorion membrane (dHACM).
