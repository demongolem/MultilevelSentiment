Salem Red Sox News Release
FREDERICK, MD - Starting pitcher Denyi Reyes dazzled once again, and the Salem Red Sox plated six runs on six consecutive hits in the second inning to power a 7-2 rout of the Frederick Keys at Harry Grove Stadium.
The Sox (25-27, 57-63) took a series victory against the Keys and clinched victory in the season series between the two clubs. Frederick (22-30, 57-64) drew within four runs in the third but never got closer than that again, stranding the bases loaded in the bottom of the eighth.
Salem wasted little time on offense, as they gave themselves a healthy cushion against Frederick starting pitcher Cristian Alvarado (L, 10-10) in the second inning. With one out, Josh Tobias hit a liner to third that Jomar Reyes flubbed, and Tobias reached first base on the miscue. Michael Osinski rapped a single to left, bringing Tobias to second base. Jake Romanski hammered a double to right-center field, scoring Tobias and advancing Osinski up to third base. Victor Acosta cleared the bases with a double down the right-field line, and came home to score when Ryan Scott knocked a single through the right side; Scott sped to second on the throw. Tyler Hill lined a single into the gap in left-center to plate Scott, and Brett Netzer capped the rally with an RBI double to right-center, scoring Hill and giving Salem a 6-0 edge.
The Keys got on the board in the bottom of the third against Denyi Reyes (W, 2-1), with Daniel Fajardo cracking a one-out single before speeding to third on a double by Jake Ring. T.J. Nichting brought in Fajardo on a sacrifice fly to center, and Wilson Garcia rocked a double to right to score Ring and cut Salem's lead to 6-2.
The Sox earned a run back in the top of the fourth inning. With two away, Netzer smoked a laser into the gap in right-center field for another double, and C.J. Chatham stroked a single into center that allowed Netzer to score, running the Salem lead to 7-2, where it would stay the rest of the game.
Denyi Reyes was superb for Salem, allowing two runs on just four hits while striking out six batters in seven innings. Joan Martinez worked around a hit and two walks in two scoreless innings, fanning two.
The Sox return home Friday night to open up a weekend series against the Down East Wood Ducks. Righty Jake Thompson will take the ball for Salem in the series opener against Down East right-hander Steven Bruce. First pitch from Haley Toyota Field is scheduled for 7:05 p.m., and the pregame show with Ben Gellman and Suzie Cool begins at 6:45 p.m. on the Red Sox broadcast network
