"The Pope is the earthly head of the Church, the Vicar of Christ," she says. "I believe his message will be one of inspiration, direction and advice for the people of God in Ireland."<br />At the last official count, there were 5,730 sisters in Ireland's 26 dioceses, outnumbering all the priests and brothers put together.<br />Sister Angela Finegan also lives in the Cistercian monastery and is excited for the moment of self-reflection that Pop Francis will bring to Ireland.<br />"It will be a great joy and blessing. Especially in the days when the presence of God and the life of the Church are hidden in our fast-paced society," she says.<br />Image copyright<br />Image copyright<br />Clodagh Kilcoyne/ Reuters<br />Thousands ascend the conical peak of Croagh Patrick on the holy mountain's traditional pilgrimage days in July and August.<br />Many of them are blessed after Mass at the summit in the modern chapel. For many Catholics, the Pope's upcoming visit is a boost for the faithful amidst the rapidly changing social landscape of Ireland.<br />Earlier this year, 66% of the country voted to repeal a part of the constitution that effectively banned abortions. This followed on from a 2015 referendum where Ireland overwhelmingly voted to legalise same-sex marriage. It is the first country in the world to do this through a popular vote.<br />"A lot of Catholics have gone a-la-carte, but being Catholic is very serious," said Marie Campbell, who joined the pilgrims who scale the mountain in the western County Mayo every July in honour of Saint Patrick, Ireland's patron saint.<br />"Our Catholic faith stands for life. It's the very centre of being Catholic. We cherish life, life is sacred, and a lot of Catholics need to be reminded of these things."<br />Image copyright<br /
