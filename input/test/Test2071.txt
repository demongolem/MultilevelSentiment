Ambient images Concept TOOaPICNIC is a series of benches with a wide scope of applications. You can use them in offices, Activity Based Work (ABW) environments, restaurants, hotel lobbies and waiting areas. The Dutch designers Jules Vreeswijk and Joost Waltjen have carefully built up the TOOaPICNIC series. Each variant has a specific application and therefore a unique look. Especially in an Activity Based Work environment the furniture must be obvious. The function of furniture should not have to be explained and must invite to use. TOOaPICNIC can be expanded with various accessories such as an integrated power supply for laptops and mobile phones. Also optional is an extra large table top with which you can easily couple two TOOaPICNIC benches and create a 4-persons unit. Make reques
