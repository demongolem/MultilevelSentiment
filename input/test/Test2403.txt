Shares of Dillard's Inc. DDS slumped 8.7% yesterday despite reporting top- and bottom-line beat for second-quarter fiscal 2018. Investors were probably not happy with the company's loss per share results, which led to the decline in shares. Another reason behind the stock's fall can be the general weakness seen in department store stocks, including Macy's M , which also fell considerably following its robust earnings show on Aug 15.
Albeit, Dillard's shares have increased 26.2% year to date, reflecting gains from its strategic actions coupled with impressive surprise history. Despite recording growth, this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock has underperformed the industry 's increase of 34%.
Notably, Dillard's boasts a robust surprise history, having reported bottom-line beat in the last four quarters and positive sales surprise in the trailing five quarters, including the fiscal second quarter. Moreover, the company's constant efforts to capitalize on growth opportunities in its brick-and-mortar stores and e-commerce business remain encouraging. Its focus on increasing productivity, enhancing domestic operations and developing omni-channel platform is also likely to strengthen the customer base.
Q2 Numbers
Dillard's reported loss per share of 10 cents, narrower than loss of 58 cents in the prior-year quarter. The bottom line compared favorably with the Zacks Consensus Estimate of loss of 41 cents.
