Don't Play
As the game gets underway, the closet All Blacks fan is happiest when Brodie Retallick scores after 28 phases. It may not be a classic try, but wait till you hear the terrible personal story Retallick is coming back from. And by telling that story, the closet All Blacks fan somehow makes it about them.
When the Wallabies start doing well, they're dismissive. "That Folau try? It only came from a kick. Lottery. It doesn't really count. And did you hear what Folau said about gay people? And did you hear that New Zealand rugby players combined with one voice to denounce him? Oh, Pocock? Well, he's still playing alongside Folau, isn't he?" The closet All Blacks fan is morally superior to you in ways you haven't been morally upright to even think about yet.
The closet All Blacks fan doesn't get worried when, in the first half, the Wallabies find themselves in the lead. "Yeah but they are only competitive because Foley keeps landing penalty goals." And the closet All Blacks fan calls him "Luke Foley". On purpose.
Then at half-time there will be footage from the changing rooms. Every time Michael Cheika is shown on screen, the closet All Blacks fan will say, "This has nothing to do with rugby, but this is a serious issue â€“ that guy really needs to see someone". And whenever the cameras go to Steve Hanson, they will chuckle, "He's so calm, like the Buddha".
As the second half progresses, even if New Zealand haven't put the match beyond doubt, the closet All Blacks fan will reel of statistics of the points differential when their 'finishers' come on, how they are the best team in the world because they have the best 16 to 22. How they can replace the world's best scrumhalf, Aaron Smith, with the world's second-best, T.J. Perenara. And the world's third-best, Tawera Kerr-Barlow, can't even get into the squad. And meanwhile, Australia are so desperate that Nick Phipps, off the bench, has won something like 70 Test caps.
But they're still pretending they're Australian, so they'll couch it in terms of sorrow. Like, "The fact that Nick Phipps has won 70 Test caps, doesn't that say a lot about the pitiful decline of rugby in our schools. In New Zealand, on the other handâ€¦"
If the unexpected happens and Australia get on top, the closet All Blacks fan will slyly change the subject and talk about culture and politics. How we struggle to find our own Flight of the Conchords. "Did you see Hunt for the Wilderpeople ? When did Australians stop being about to laugh at ourselves, like the Kiwis can?" And then they'll enumerate the progressive policies of a 38-year-old woman prime minister and fantasise about a love match between Jacinda Ardern and Justin Trudeau. In Australia, meanwhile, our political culture is so far back in the stone age that our parliament has unearthed a guy who manages to make Peter Dutton look like a sensible centrist. (This is again phrased in self-pitying tones, as if lamenting what Australia has become, when the truth is that they actually like New Zealand better than Australia, and they would bloody well go and live there except that they couldn't get a job and the exchange rate for the NZD is so poorâ€¦)
Yes, the closet All Blacks fan is, if nothing else, better than you. For even though the All Blacks are the perennial overdogs, New Zealand is a country of underdogs. "And you've got to love them for that. And you've got to love me for loving them."
(No, I don't mean me me. Otherwise I'd be out of the closet.)
The final tell for the closet All Blacks fan is that, come the end of the Test match, they are always wearing a smile. If New Zealand have won, it's a smile gleefully imagining the sad faces at some Shore School Old Boys reunion at the Oaks Hotel. Or, it's a good-loser smile of appreciation. "But hey, you've got to admire the ABs, you just don't see rugby played that way anywhere else." Or, if Australia win, it's the fake smile. "Go, Wallabies! I knew we'd get them one day!" But you can tell it's fake, because until they admit they really want the All Blacks to win, they are fundamentally deceitful and they are not your friends.
So, what to do about them. These unAustralian Australians are not us. Who let these closet All Blacks fans in? There must be an interim solution â€“ a Pacific solution? â€“ and whatever it is, we must get them to pay for it
