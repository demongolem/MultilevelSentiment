KidTreasures.com About KC Kids Fun
KC Kids Fun was created in early 2008 by two friends who found themselves in the early stages of parenting. When they couldn't find something that met their needs (an unbiased, comprehensive directory-driven site chock full of things to do), they built it. The initial incarnation of this website received such an amazing response, first from friends and then from strangers, that they immediately began to think a little bit bigger.
Founded by local moms Kiran Chandra and Kate McKinney â€” the site is now owned by KC Kids Fun team members Jane Martin and Scott Schaper . Scott has been part of the team since 2009, and Jane since 2013. Jane Martin Jane is a working mom whose passion is to help other parents and grandparents enjoy all that Kansas City has to offer. As a mother of two, she understands the limited amount of time parents have to get out and enjoy life with their kids. Jane became the voice of KC Kids Fun in 2013. Her goal in life is to take full advantage of all that our great city has to offer her familyâ€¦especially if that means getting her kids off of screens! Scott Schaper Scott is the owner and founder of The Unravel Corporation, a digital marketing agency focused on Content Strategy. Through his work at Unravel, Scott began working with Kiran and Kate in the early stages of the site development. He is an active member in Kansas City's marketing sector, and is well known for helping hundreds of businesses align their technological footprint with their brand. An alumnus of University of Kansas, Scott enjoys spending time with his wife and two sons, cycling, hiking, cooking, and live music.
