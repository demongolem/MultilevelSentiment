Who is Pianeta? A former European heavyweight champion, the 33-year-old will be a five stone disadvantage against Fury and is four inches shorter.
Pianeta has four losses on his record from 40 fights as a pro: to Wladimir Klitschko (2013), Ruslan Chagaev (2015), Kevin Johnson (2017) and Petar Milas (2018). He is currently ranked 138 in the world and should provide a stiffer test than Seferi who retired injured after four rounds.
Who could Fury fight next? F ury would love a showdown with Anthony Joshua eventually , but a meeting with WBC champion Deontay Wilder could be the headline fight within his sights. A unification fight between Wilder and Joshua has failed to materialise despite months of speculation. Fury vs Wilder could take place in Las Vegas in November or December this year.
Career record | Tyson Fury What has been said? T yson Fury:
"I'm feeling healthy as a trout, fit as a flea. I'm very happy, everything is going smoothly, injury-free, training is going well. Just the same routine day in, day out for the last 10 weeks. I've had two or three days off since my last fight, I got straight back in the gym.
"I can't be any fitter than I was when I fought Sefer. There's only a certain amount of fitness you can do in boxing, it's not about fitness, to be honest.
"If you're going to be in a fight you have to be fit anyway. You shouldn't be taking fights if you're not fit.
"I've lost another stone if that makes a difference -- not really.
"Was I not fit against Sefer? Of course I was, I trained my guts out for seven months. I was fit to do 30 rounds but he only lasted four rounds so that was his problem, not mine.
"I've eaten, slept and drunk boxing -- I've done nothing else but box since November. So if I can't beat Pianeta I might as well get on my knees and kiss his two feet because I'm clearly shot to pieces.
"But if I'm half the man I was a few years ago, I will write Pianeta off like a good'un, put a face on him like the Elephant Man."
Tyson Fury: How rookie trainer Ben Davison 'saved life' of Gypsy King F rank Warren:
"Fury versus Wilder will be the fight of the year bar none - and whoever wins it will be the world's No1 heavyweight.
"The people around Joshua don't want him anywhere near Wilder. They don't want to kill the golden goose. But we're just waiting on the contract and Tyson is mentally ready.
"When a fighter is in a good place in his head, the rest falls into place. And he fancies the job against Wilder. Boxers can lose their edge when they've been out of the ring but it isn't going to happen to Fury, who is only 30, is undefeated and back in love with the sport."
What are the best odds? Tyson Fury win 1/100 Draw 33 /1 Francesco Pianeta win 25/1 What is our prediction? T his is another stepping stone on Fury's comeback and should be more competitive than his fight against Sefer Seferi which descended into a circus. Fury should have too much skill and ring-craft for an ageing Pianeta however, so we fancy him to win by knockout or technical knockout by round seven or eight
