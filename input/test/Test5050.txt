MIAMI TWP. â€” The decision to become part of a state program tracking government spending online will pay dividends for Miami Twp., according to the Ohio treasurer's office.
"This means that people are going to get better decision-making on how their leaders (provide) more efficient government," treasurer's office Senior Public Affairs Liaison Lauren Bowen said of trustees' adoption of the program this week.
"For instance, instead of going to a conference in Hawaii, public employees are going to a conference in Cincinnati," she said. "Or perhaps, rather than staying in a Ritz-Carlton, they choose the Holiday Inn."
