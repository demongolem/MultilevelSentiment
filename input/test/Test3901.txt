This week in tech tidbits from the world of wearable news: Google seems to be developing its own smartwatch hardware, Apple is hiring engineers to focus on new health possibilities for the Apple Watch, the Marines get a new fitness app and exactly what is the future for fitness trackers? The Week in Wearables is a news digest, out each week, focused on some of the things that have happened in the world of tech you can wear on your wrist, perch on your head, stick in your ear, sling around your waist, tuck into the small of your back or, well, you get the idea.

Apple Beefing Up Watch Health Chips
According to CNBC, Apple's Health Sensing hardware team is being increased, suggesting even better health capabilities.
Apple has a team exploring a custom processor that can make better sense of health information coming off sensors from deep inside its devices, job listings show.
The effort hints at Apple's ability to pump out custom chips on as-needed basis, reflecting a greater level of vertical integration than other technology companies. Building custom chips for narrow functions can help Apple add new features and improve efficiency of its hardware while protecting its intellectual property from would-be imitators.

Google Pixel Watch Incoming Soon?
More evidence is emerging that Google is likely making its own wrist-borne hardware.
The Apple Watch is the smartwatch other companies seek to beat. And it looks like Google may be about to try and do that with the launch of its own timepiece, to be called the Pixel Watch.
After all, although Samsung has just released its Samsung Galaxy Watch and Fitbit has several strong contenders, neither of those, are watches running Google's wearable-oriented operating system, called Wear OS (previously Android Wear). The Samsung favors the company's own Tizen system and Fitbit has its own OS.
So, will the launch of the Google Pixel 3 and Pixel 3 XL smartphones, expected in the fall, soon after the next slew of iPhones are predicted to arrive , also see the announcement of Google's first own-brand smartwatch?

Future of fitness trackers
This topic is explored in detail in a highly interesting feature at Wareable. As Conor Allison explains:
After being the spearhead for the wearable revolution, and becoming the way to track your daily 10,000 steps, users now want more from their fitness bands; they crave internal sensors, bigger, better screens and something that can turn their wrist from dumb to smart.
But are we really watching the death of the fitness tracker play out before our eyes, or is the market simply experiencing a lull before delivering a riposte that helps it surge back in line with smartwatches?
Well, right now, it's in the balance, but there are things in the works that indicate fitness trackers could soon be back on the up. Below, we'll take a closer look at the companies we believe will continue to lead the fitness tracker charge and explore potential next-generation features that they could look to help make sure these trackers are still part of the wearable furniture for a while yet.
Well worth a read, over at Wareable .
And finallyâ€¦
The Marines are getting an app to help with their fitness. I don't that regularly turn to Marine Corps Times, but that's where this story originatedâ€¦
The Corps is working on a new phone fitness app that will aid Marines in programing fitness routines to tracking injuries across a unit, and the Marines want the app to complement wearable tech like the popular Fitbit fitness trackers.
The new application will help the Corps' nearly 600 Force Fitness Instructors , or FFIs, create balanced fitness regimens that could support the force's goal of reducing injuries and tracking overall fitness of a unit or individual Marine.
A Marine will be able to access the app through his phone and see what he is "going to be doing 30 days from now, next week, or tomorrow," Col. Stephen Armes, the director of the Force Fitness Division, told Marine Corps Times in an interview.
I mean, it's not like they're not fit already but I guess it can't hurt. More at our surprise guest publication, Marine Corps Times .
