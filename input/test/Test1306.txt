"RBG,"<br />co-produced by CNN, has made $13.5 million at the box office, according to comScore, and will be broadcast next month on the network. Oscar nominee Felicity Jones will play her in a feature film, "On the Basis of Sex," in December.<br />The justice said recently that she hopes to stay on the Supreme Court at<br />least five more years<br />, when she'll be 90. She has survived two bouts with cancer, colorectal in 1999 and pancreatic in 2009.<br />Ginsburg's celebrity might not have been predicted when President Bill Clinton chose her for the high court in summer 1993.<br />Then a 60-year-old federal appellate judge, she was not Clinton's first choice.

But she still conveys a modest approach. When asked recently during a public appearance how she wanted to be remembered, she said, "As someone who did the best she could."<br />Photos:<br />Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg<br />Ruth Bader Ginsburg is the second woman to serve on the US Supreme Court.
