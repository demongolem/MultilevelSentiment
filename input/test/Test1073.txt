World's top-selling cider brand brings to life its refreshing "Moments of Natural Refreshment" campaign From a dilapidated bus stop transformed into an awe-inspiring vertical garden to a 'Butterfly Effect' release of 8,000 biodegradable paper butterflies, Strongbow Apple Ciders is on a mission to rejuvenate South Africa's cities with nature.
The global cider brand, which has become the top-selling cider throughout the world, believes that nature is the most refreshing thing on Earth.
Strongbow uses natural fruit to create a refreshing range of ciders and uses natural refreshment to rejuvenate people in cities across the globe.
"Urban life is fantastic," says Lance Dodgen, Marketing Manager for Strongbow South Africa. "But as exciting as it can be, it can also become draining. The traffic, the queues, the hustle and bustle â€“ it can all get a bit hectic. So, to counter that we want to use nature to rejuvenate and re-inspire South Africans so they can get back to enjoying the city life they love."
The "Moments of Natural Refreshment" campaign kicked off when the cider brand arrived on South African shores two years ago.
"We've looked for key moments in people's days that are usually the most hectic, and we've tried to make them as refreshing as possible by using our ultimate tool â€“ nature!
"Studies have shown that commuting to work is one of the most stressful moments of the day," says Dodgen. "So, that was one of the urban experience we looked to refresh."
Thus, a bus stop in Rivonia, Johannesburg, which had fallen into disrepair was transformed into a vertical garden featuring a plant canopy offering commuters shade from the heat of the summer sun while motion-activated spritzers surprised them with a cooling cloud of mist. "There were even fresh apples for people to enjoy while they waited for their bus," said Dodgen.
Meanwhile Rosebank, the Johannesburg suburb undergoing a massive overhaul with cranes blighting the skyline, was the site of another innovative activation.
"We know how stressful and unpleasant it can be to walk through a construction site. It was particularly bad at the Rosebank Gautrain station, which had a construction safety tunnel that was dark, smelly, loud and uninviting. So, we turned that construction tunnel into a truly naturally refreshing experience by lining the walls with hanging plants and flowers. This didn't just make the tunnel beautiful, it naturally sound-proofed the tunnel walls to keep the construction noise at bay."
Other activations included an office building refreshed during one of the hottest days of the year by bringing nature indoors, thanks to a 100-strong choir which replicated the sound of a thunderstorm using just their hands, bodies and voices; an "Inner City Waterfall" at a Cape Town club and the release of 8,000 biodegradable paper butterflies in the sky above Braamfontein.
"People stopped what they were doing and just looked at the sky. The butterflies were embedded with the seeds of indigenous plants so that wherever they fell, they would bring nature into the city. But anyone who actually caught a butterfly would see that each one was a coupon to redeem an ice-cold Strongbow at the local bar."
Strongbow will continue its mission to bring nature, rejuvenation and inspiration into people's lives during the course of this year. "We have no intention of stopping now. This is just the beginning of our journey in South Africa," says Dodgen.
