They have been a much-valued feature of British high streets for more than 160 years.
But public loos are being wiped out at a staggering rate as councils struggle with government budget cuts.
More than a QUARTER of public toilets have disappeared since the turn of the century, according to data obtained under Freedom of Information laws.
According to the new information - supplied by council areas across the UK - the total number of public toilets across the country has dropped from 3,084 in 2000 to 2,290 in 2018. That is a fall of nearly 800.
And authorities in Bolsover, North East Derbyshire, and Wokingham admitted they no longer had ANY council-run loos.
In London, of the councils that provided information, the number of public loos was down from 197 in 2000 to just 132 today.
The rest of England saw a fall from 2,400 to 1,534, while in Wales numbers had more than halved from 504 to 243.
Scotland was down from 759 to 421 while Northern Ireland dropped from 95 to 84. Britain's first public toilet was built in 1852, in London's Hyde Park
Campaigners say the problem leaves people with nowhere to go when they need to go and it is affecting everyone from outdoor workers such as builders as well as pregnant women and parents with children. Toilets that can be easily found and used are essential for the elderly and disabled.
And with one in five people above 40 suffering from an over-active bladder, the lack of public facilities can make some reluctant to leave their homes due to the risk of being caught short.
It is not a legal requirement to provide public lavatories and so when councils aren't feeling flush, toilet blocks are often targeted first when it comes to cuts. A typical toilet block is estimated to cost between Â£12,000 to Â£15,000 a year to maintain.
But Domestos believes that clean, safe toilets should be within everyone's reach. That is why it is launching the nationwide Use Our Loos initiative to tackle the demise and unlock loos in local coffee shops, cafes, restaurants and bars across Britain's towns, cities and villages. It costs a council around Â£15,000 per year to run a toilet block
The scheme is urging local shops and businesses to sign up, throw open their cubicles and make their toilets available to non-customers.
As part of the initiative, Domestos is also partnering with The Great British Public Toilet Map â€“ an interactive street map that shows users where their nearest public toilet is and which businesses have signed up to the scheme.
The map will be regularly updated as new businesses join.
Domestos also plays a role in the Unilever Sustainable Living Plan's aim to get 25 million people across the world access to a clean and safe toilet by 2020. Domestos has partnered with Unicef, the world's leading children's organisaÂ­tion, since 2012 and has already helped 10 million people around the world get cleaner, safer toilets. Around 20 percent of people over 40 suffer from an overactive bladder
Raymond Martin of the British Toilet Association which campaigns for better public facilities, has praised the initiative, saying it will increase visitors to Britain's high streets.
He says : "As human beings we all have to eat, drink, sleep, breathe and go to the toilet," he said. "Having access to a clean hygienic toilet is absolutely vital for our everyday life and activity."
Rebecca Light, Domestos Senior Brand Manager, says: "In the UK the problem is locating a public toilet. An estimated 2.3 billion people worldwide lack access to clean, safe sanitation. This comes with significant health risks, including diarrhoea, which kills one child every two minutes. It's vital we change this â€“ and quickly." Join the Use Our Loos campaign
In the UK, many people take it for granted that they can access a clean toilet. But with the number of council-run loos falling, the search is becoming harder.
