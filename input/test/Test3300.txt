Dr. Maggard Basketball Schedule Comments _ _ _ _ Ragin Cajuns Ragin' Cajuns Greatest Fan Ever Join Date Re: Dr. Maggard Basketball Schedule Comments Originally  Balanced_view you just said no one wanted to play Gonzaga and member of the west coast conference, but they won a lot and here we are today with them, then you say we really need out this conference so bad. you sounded like its time to stop with excuses, then you gave one. so is it the conference fault, or the individual school? because it started off as a no excuses example of how a individual school can overcome its conference by winning enough. No one wanted to travel to Spokane to play a WCC team, so Gonzaga traveled, eventually won, made a name for themselves, got invited to tournaments, made the playoffs, went to Final Fours, and became a perennial top 20 and even top 10 team. Even today, I don't think they get many P5 schools to play them at their home. Their conference eventually got better, but they overcame their conference by winning big in the road. We are in a weak conference and will have to overcome that similarly. If the P5 schools won't come to us, we go to them. Winning will make a name for us, eventually get us out of the SBC and into a better conference and scheduling can better take care if itself.

They are playing several schools in the south on their November trip. I bet they are a little better than most non D1's we play. Interesting that their 2017-18 schedule shows ALL of their games were on the US mainland.

Without that requirement we might have gone on the road more this season as we had to buy four of the five non conference opponents. We pay a minimal amount to the non D1 schools.

UVI should be much better, given they were patchwork last year following the two cat 5 hurricanes crippled their island last September. They do very well picking up D-1 guys that desire a change of scenery with a budget that brings the phrase "shoe string" to a whole new level.

Now, if we can afford a 1.5 mill nutrition budget that didn't exist a couple years ago, why can't we afford 2 or 300k per year to buy a couple basketball games? Is that really an economically feasible idea? That seems very expensive for one vanity game. Of course, I dont know how much money a basketball game makes. If we would recoup a healthy percentage of that from the gate, maybe it would be worthwhile.

Now it's time to hear some potential solutions. Freak thinking read the freaking books!!! Lol Ragin Cajuns of Louisiana Go-Cajuns Join Date Re: Dr. Maggard Basketball Schedule Comments Originally  Cajunsmike Improving our conference situation should be a priority. However, there have to be openings before we can move and Dr. Maggard does not believe that will happen anytime soon. We do need to be poised to be in the best candidate when an opening does occur. When I say Conference, I am referring to getting us into the best position to be considered. That is media capabilities, marketing, etc. I believe a higher profile basketball program would help that as well. No doubt a good bit of the work helps in multiple priorities.

We have played 2 to 3 power teams per season for several years now. That will continue. Once again we have to play at least 14 home games. Getting tired of writing that but it continues to be a factor some overlook. Anyway that limits the no. of power teams we can play as we have to play some home and home games against the state schools to meet that requirement. As far as the league is concerned, I agree it must improve. However it is not nearly as bad as some make it out to be. Last year there were 12 leagues rated below us and the year before there were more below the SBC than above it. That needs to be the case more years than not. Just providing context to the issues presented
