Schnatter's Alma Mater Votes To Remove Name, Return Donation Posted: Updated: MGN
MUNCIE, Ind. (LEX 18)-- Ball State University will remove the name of alumnus and Papa John's founder John Schnatter from a business institute because of his use of a racial slur.
School trustees voted 8-1 Thursday to remove the name from the Institute for Entrepreneurship and Free Enterprise and return money donated by the Schnatter Family Foundation.
The vote came nearly two weeks after the trustees issued a statement Aug. 3 supporting Schnatter.
The Schnatter Family Foundation and the Charles Koch Foundation donated $3.25 million in 2016 to create the institute. WEATHER Updated: Thursday, August 16 2018 12:56 PM EDT 2018-08-16 16:56:11 GMT
