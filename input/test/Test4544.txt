The owner of Plymouth's top-rated restaurant is growing her food business and has taken on a second venue - and has introduced bubble tea to Plymouth.
Prissana Hosakon, also known as Pond, is the woman behind the hugely successful @kitchen based on the mezzanine of Plymouth Market .
Since opening in 2016, it's scooped the first place position on Trip Advisor as the best-rated restaurant in the whole city.
But now she's branching out and has taken on the lease for a shop front adjoined to the market on Cornwall Street.
The new eatery is named Tea & Bun and it opened on Thursday on the ground floor of the market, directly underneath her existing business. We went for an exclusive look around the venue before it officially opened and can confirm you are in for an absolute treat.

"I wanted to build on the success of @kitchen," he said, "and invest not only in Tea & Bun, but also invest in Pond to bring her magic to the new place.
"I want to bring her skill and new food ideas to Plymouth and the market."
Pond added: "People care about what they eat, something like this is good for everybody - it's not out of a packet."
This is something I can definitely attest to. Pond cooked us almost every item on the menu during our visit and the food was prepared fresh and fast. Whether you're passing by on a quick lunch break or for a leisurely afternoon, visitors can expect a variety of high quality dishes.
The prices are very reasonable too, with the most expensive dish - an enormous bowl of Ramen - coming in at Â£7.50. Read More What did we eat at Tea & Bun? Fried gyoza with soy dip We tried the fried gyoza with soy dip and it was delicious (Image: Penny Cross)
This dish is a delightful snack, enough to satisfy an empty stomach with its pork filling and crispy shell.
This and the chicken kara-age would be a perfect introduction if you are new to Asian cuisine and want to test the waters before diving straight it. Chicken kara-age with spicy mayo Is your mouth watering yet? (Image: Penny Cross)
Imagine popcorn chicken at KFC except much nicer, fresher, lighter and tastier.
This petite chicken dish comes with a fabulous breadcrumb-style coating and is perfect for dipping into the spicy mayo. You'll find this on the snack section of the menu, so you might like to team it up with another dish to complete a lunch or dinner meal. Sticky Ribs with fried onion
You might struggle with chop sticks on this one but thankfully Tea & Bun has plenty of cutlery to help you tuck into this juicy pork dish. It's a brilliant size for one person to enjoy, but by the end you may wish you'd ordered two or three portions they're just that good. Soy Ramen The soy ramen, shiitake mushroom broth with soy tare, chashu pork belly and bamboo shoot - delish (Image: Penny Cross)
Ramen is a very popular Japanese dish. The noodles are served with bean sprouts and spring onion in broth - leaving a wonderful combination of textures and flavours for you to enjoy.
There is a whole Ramen menu including options like soy ramen, pork ramen and miso ramen for vegetarians, vegans and meat eaters alike. This of course is served in large, deep bowls and will definitely fill you up. Steamed Buns The spicy Korean chilli jackfruit steamed harita buns are simply stunning (Image: Penny Cross)
There are several steamed buns for you to try. We tried cha-shu pork and Korean chilli jackfruit.
Jackfruit is an increasingly popular meat alternative and I would thoroughly recommend trying if if you haven't already. The steamed buns are smooth and soft, and are also beautiful and light in comparison to having something like bread. And last but not least... bubble tea!

Tea & Bun got its name for a reason and that's because they sell a lovely selection of bubble teas. It's important to note that all the drinks are cold, even the milk tea.
We tried lychee oolong tea which has big lychees sitting in amongst the ice cubes and is very sweet and refreshing. But I have to say, my stand out was the mango green tea with popping balls. It's amazingly tasty and even more so once you get hold of a popping bubble.
To start with, the new restaurant will be open during market hours, but as they have a street facing shop front, the option to open later into the evening could well be possible. It will be difficult to give the infamous @kitchen a run for its money, but if any place is going to do it, it's going to be Tea & Bun. What do we think
