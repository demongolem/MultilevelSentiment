In addition to the above skill set, we require Networking/Linux Skills also.
Should also know how to optimise the website to make it load quick, should also be aware of google's page speed module.
-- About the Project:-
We are trying to develop a platform for Managed Hosting, Where we would be using API's provided by the hosting providers to assign cloud servers for individual users depending upon the plan that the user selects, after that we would automatically install all the technologies and migrate his website from third-party server to our node automatically. If it is a CMS platform like Wordpress/Joomla/Magento, then we can make him install our migrator plugin which he can set up on his website and migrate it to our server handsfree.
If it is a PHP/Nodejs/Golang/Python platform, then we can migrate it using FTP or SSH or also by making him install our script on his website.
The platform should be developed in such a way that we focus both on Security, Speed of the website, Reducing the load on the server and also the load time of the site, and backup facility (On-demand & Daily Backup's).
We will also provide CDN by default to all the clients along with Email Services from Google, (Gmail for Business).
