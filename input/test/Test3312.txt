Tags : iOS - iOS + Apple - Apple + Tablets - Tablets + Deals - Deals + Apple hasn't changed the design of its iPads much over the past few years, making it fairly easy to confuse the company's latest 9.7-inch model with 2014's iPad Air 2 . In fact, the extremely well-reviewed tablet that was discontinued last year to make room for a non-Pro, non-Air new iPad is both thinner and lighter than 2018's Apple Pencil-enabled 9.7-incher. The iPad Air 2 also comes with a timeless 2048 x 1536 "Retina" display, very capable 8MP rear and 1.2MP front cameras, a solid 2GB RAM, and perhaps most importantly, iOS 12 support . Otherwise put, this bad boy can definitely hold its own against "modern" Android slates, which makes Amazon's latest "Deal of the Day" a straight-up bargain. For just $300, you can get a certified refurbished Apple iPad Air 2 with a generous 128GB storage space, although you'll obviously need to hurry. Three different color options are in stock at the time of this writing, with the silver variant fetching $299, and gold and space gray flavors going for $299.99 each. Technically, this is not an item shipped and sold directly by Amazon, but fret not, as BuySpry is a reliable, "specialized", and approved third-party retailer. By far the best thing about this deal is that you get a full 1-year warranty, and the iPad Air 2 units on sale are naturally "tested and certified to work and look like-new." Keep in mind that you can find certified refurbished iPads on the online Apple Store as well, but this particular configuration, with Wi-Fi connectivity only and 128 gigs of storage, currently costs $359. So, yeah, you're looking at a cool $60 discount today on Amazon
