The alkaline diet is also called as alkaline ash diet or acid-alkaline diet. The diet is used to enhance health by emphasising on fresh fruits and vegetables.
The alkaline diet works in such a way that the body burns the food and turns it into energy leaving an ash residue. This ash makes the body's pH more alkaline. The diet is considered healthy because it is based on real and unprocessed foods.
