The fire broke out in a residential building near Park Station at about 2pm on Thursday. Butâ€š Johannesburg Emergency Management Services spokesperson Nana Radebe said the firefighters were able to talk the residents of the building down â€“ and, ultimatelyâ€š nobody jumped. Radebe said emergency services contained the fire to the first floor before extinguishing it within two-and-a-half-hours of the fire starting. Radebe said nobody was injuredâ€š but a baby was treated on scene for smoke inhalation before being taken to hospital for further treatment.

Siam Lee's murder accused to appear in court The man accused of the kidnapping and murder of escort Siam Lee is expected to make an appearance in the Durban Magistrate's court on Friday. The 30-year-old businessman faces a raft of charges. He cannot be named until he has tendered a plea to a rape charge. Magistrate Mahomed Motala granted the 30-year-old R40â€š000 bail on in June, which brought an end to his five-month bid for freedom. The man was arrested in January several days after Leeâ€š an escortâ€š went missing from the Durban North brothel she was working at. His prosecution remains on shaky ground with bungling by police and a private investigator highlighted by the magistrate who released him. Basing their case on "circumstantial" evidence also weighed heavily against the state's opposition to bail. Cele lashed for failing to protect whistleblowers A report by Public Protector Busisiwe Mkhwebane has found that the failure of Police Minister Bheki Cele and the SAPS to provide protection to whistleblowers on corruption and political killings in KwaZulu-Natal was grossly negligent. Cele's office said on Thursday the minister intended to challenge the report. In a report dated August 10â€š Mkhwebane found that Cele and the police's failure to protect two men who blew the whistle on corruption - which they claimed was behind the murder of former ANC Youth League secretary general Sindiso Magaqa - could have resulted in the assassination of the two men. The whistleblowersâ€š Thabiso Zulu and Les Stutaâ€š testified before the Moerane Commission of Inquiry into political killings in KwaZulu-Natal in November last year. Following death threats and a lack of action from the policeâ€š Zulu sought the intervention of the public protector.

Mugg & Bean manager reemployed after furore Mugg & Bean has reemployed a member of staff who claimed that he lost his job because customers did not want to be served by a black manager. Andile Bozo ignited a fierce debate on social media when he attributed his retrenchment to racismâ€š alleging that the franchisee at the Somerset West Waterstone Village mall told him that customers wanted a white manager. Mugg & Bean said it was unfortunate that the retrenchment â€“ due to weak trading conditions in a challenging economy â€“ had been perceived as racist and had turned into a public furore. Mugg & Bean operations executive Jeanne Geldenhuys said on Thursday that the matter had been resolved and Bozo would be reemployed in the group. It is unclear which role Bozo will be taking up in the group.

Peter Fisher, 67, was riding his bicycle through central London on Wednesday when he was involved in a collision with a truck, British media reported. Police said a 67-year-old cyclist died at the scene. Fisher was director of research at the Royal London Hospital for Integrated Medicine, and physician to the queen, said Gill Gaskin, medical director at University College London Hospitals.

Cropmarks (patterns of shading in crops and grass seen most clearly from the air) form faster in hot weather as fields dry out, making this summer's heatwave ideal for discovering such sites. Archaeologists at the public body Historic England has been looking for patterns revealing the ancient sites, from Yorkshire in the north down to Cornwall in the southwest. 'We've discovered hundreds of new sites this year spanning about 6,000 years of England's history,' said Damian Grady, aerial reconnaissance manager at Historic England. The archaeologists are mapping the sites to determine the significance of the remains beneath and how best to protect them. - Reuters Late for your flight? Call in a bomb A French man who was late for his flight from London to Los Angeles tried to delay it by calling police to say there was a bomb on board. Librarian Jacob Meir Abdellak, who lives in east London, made the call eight minutes before his 5.47am Norwegian Air flight from Gatwick Airport was due to leave on May 11 because he was significantly late and airline staff had refused to allow him on board, a court heard. Passengers had to be re-screened and take-off was delayed by 90 minutes. An investigation by Gatwick revealed the call had been made using the same number linked to his booking. When Abdellak returned to the airport to take another flight to the US on May 22, he was arrested. He initially claimed he had lost his phone's SIM card but on Tuesday pleaded guilty to communicating false information regarding a noxious substance likely to create serious risk to human health. He was sentenced to 10 months in prison. - Reuters Disney World a great place for 'predator priest' A priest accused in the Pennsylvania abuse scandal was given a reference by his diocese and went on to work at Walt Disney World for 18 years, it has emerged.

US District Judge Robert Sweet in Manhattan denied Weinstein's motion to dismiss the lawsuit filed in 2017 by Kadian Noble. The judge said that while the case was 'not an archetypal sex-trafficking action, the allegations plausibly establish' that Weinstein may have violated the federal Trafficking Victims Protection Act. - Reuter
