The Jump<br />.<br />Towns wasn't the only blameworthy party. Thibodeau's offense seemed oddly unprepared for the Houston Rockets' switchy scheme, and Minnesota's guards didn't look for Towns on the block. More broadly, Towns' failings also could be chalked up to inexperience. That he finished the series strong says more about him than the way he started it.<br />Still, perception is reality, and Towns is perceived as a postseason disappointment. Add to that Jimmy Butler's<br />reported dissatisfaction<br />with his teammate and a lingering offense-only reputation, and Towns has loads to prove.<br />A generational offensive talent, the Wolves' star center can use last spring's rough patch as motivational fuel. If that manifests in more offensive aggression, well, he's already the best scoring big man in the NBA, so defenses better be on alert. If Towns develops on D to the point where he's an average contributor, he immediately becomes one of the dozen best players in the league.<br />Motivated, entering his fourth year and already<br />, Towns is going to shut his critics up in 2018-19.<br />Gordon Hayward, Boston Celtics<br />2 of 5<br />Brian Babineau/Getty Images<br />It doesn't get much worse than a grotesque, season-ending injury just minutes into the opener, but that's exactly how Gordon Hayward's first year with the Boston Celtics began...and ended.<br />While the Boston Celtics' marquee 2017 free-agent splash may not have haters in the conventional sense, he enters 2018-19 with questions to answer and doubters to silence. Hayward has much to proveâ€”not just to outside observers, but also to his own team.<br />That's because Jayson Tatum and Jaylen Brown used his absence last season to fast-track their growth trajectories. Tatum became Boston's go-to scoring option in the playoffs (thanks to<br />'s injury), and Brown has two-way star upside that's slightly different than Tatum's potential alpha profile, but perhaps no less valuable.<br />Hayward is the high-priced vet, and<br />encouraging clips<br />of his rehab work likely suggest he isn't in danger of losing his first-unit role. But when he returns to the court for game action as a starter, he'll have to produce.<br />Boston is a legitimate contender, so there shouldn't be any room for coddling with so much at stake. Hayward will have to earn his minutes, which is no small task with both Tatum and Brown likely to improve in their second and third seasons, respectively.<br />It's easy to forget now, but Hayward was in select company before his injury. He was one of only<br />nine players<br />to average at least 19 points, five rebounds and 3.5 assists per game from 2014-15 to 2016-17, his last three healthy years. In that group, populated exclusively by MVPs and multitime All-Stars, Hayward's 37 percent conversion rate from deep trailed only<br /
