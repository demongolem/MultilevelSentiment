What this essentially means, according to various experts who spoke to Africa News 24-7 is that South Africa is going to lose about 25GW of power generation capacity from the Grid. In addition, by the year 2045 Eskom's generation capacity will be almost 0 (zero) insignificant because all the Power Plants will be out of service with only one nuclear station left with most plants being decommissioned. Eskom is also alleged to be paying for power it does not need. A series of questions needed to be put to the test where Eskom would be held accountable. Eskom is allegedly currently paying R93 million a day for energy it does not need, which totals to about R34 billion a year. According to one of the experts, if Eskom revealed the total kWh for the full year 2017 and 6 months of this year 2018 from Renewable Wind and Solar IPPs it 'actually' absorbed to the 'grid' and supplied to consumers versus the total kWh it paid them it would show that Eskom paid for something it did not need. "We need to ask Eskom why can't these IPPs contracts be moved to National Treasury and we need to understand which one is important between paying RE IPPs for kWh power it did not need and that it did not absorb versus retrenching hard-working workers who produced power that sustained the economy and the country," said Adil Nchabeleng, a member of the South African Energy Forum. According to the South African National Energy Forum, the crisis will be worse if no new power stations are built in the coming years. "Adding more Renewables will not even make a dent to the problem and looming Energy Crisis," said Nchabeleng. What was even a more cause for concern, according to some of the experts was the minister of Energy, Jeff Radebe's perceived inability to deal with the looming energy crisis and his deafening silence on the way forward in order to map out a plan that details South Africa's energy plan for the future. Some of the experts are warning that the minister's silence on the issue will have dire consequences in the near future. Information leaked to Africa News 24-7 highlights how one of the frustrated experts Hlathi Madela who is also a member of the South African Energy Forum told Radebe to "speak' and "give the country direction." In his address to the minister, Madela is alleged to have said: "If the Renewable Wind and Solar and Storage and Gas is the way to go based on facts then, by all means, run with it but show the facts to the country that you lead. If baseload New Coal and New Nuclear is the way to go also based on facts then run with it and if a certain mix of the two is the way to go based on compelling facts as we do believe then run with it. But, what you cannot longer do is to be silent. Come out of the closet and speak so that you can give the country a direction. We are here, we are your citizens and we are willing to help," he said.
