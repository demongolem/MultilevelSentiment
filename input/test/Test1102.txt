The Truth rejects you, before you reject the Truth. Advertisement Because the Truth knows the End from the beginning. But those who reject the Truth, are slow to realizing their shortcomings. The Truth laughs, for He has them in derision. He is entertained, fulfilled, yet leaving them wanting! The Lord always gets what He wants!
