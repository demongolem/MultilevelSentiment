BATON ROUGE, La. (AP) â€” LSU coach Ed Orgeron enters his second full season needing numerous unproven players to perform well to keep the Tigers competitive in 2018. The biggest questions are on offense, where there will be a new quarterback, a new running back tandem and inexperienced receivers vying for big roles. LSU opens its season against Miami in Dallas on Sept. 2.
NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) â€” NFL teams keep working to find new ways to keep players cool during the sweltering days of training camp, especially in the wake of the heat-related death of Korey Stringer in 2001 and the death of a Maryland offensive lineman in June. Tennessee debuted cooling benches in Nashville, while the New Orleans Saints combat the muggy heat in Louisiana with a refrigerated trailer. Both the Titans and Saints now can chill out during practice, which is better both for safety and a more effective workout.
TUSCALOOSA, Ala. (AP) â€” Alabama and Nick Saban begin the quest for their sixth national title as college football's ultimate power couple with many of the same old challenges _ and lots of new faces. The Crimson Tide must replace a bounty of NFL talent, especially on defense. What's new: six assistant coaches, both coordinators, pretty much the entire secondary and a quarterback battle between Jalen Hurts and Tua Tagovailoa that has made national headlines. Alabama opens Sept. 1 against Louisville in Orlando, Florida.
TUSCALOOSA, Ala. (AP) â€” Alabama is planning extensive renovations to Bryant-Denny Stadium and Coleman Coliseum, reducing capacity at both venues but adding premium seating. The university announced the plans Thursday, including a 10-year, $600 million fund-raising campaign.
AUBURN, Ala. (AP) â€” The big question facing Auburn is no longer whether the Tigers can beat rivals Georgia and Alabama. They answered that emphatically last November, wresting the Southeastern Conference Western Division title from the rival Crimson Tide. The next goals are winning an SEC title and January bowl game. Auburn opens Sept. 1 against Washington in Atlanta.
NEW YORK (AP) â€” WBC heavyweight champion Deontay Wilder says he will challenge Tyson Fury to a fight if Fury beats Francesco Pianeta.
