Research Article Novel lncRNA LINC00844 Regulates Prostate Cancer Cell Migration and Invasion Through AR Signaling Shreyas Lingadahalli , Sudhir Jadhao , Ying Ying Sung , Mi Chen , Lingling Hu , Xin Chen and Edwin Cheung Shreyas Lingadahalli PDF Abstract The human genome is mostly transcribed, yielding a rich repository of non-coding transcripts that are involved in a myriad of biological processes including cancer. However, how many non-coding transcripts such as long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) function in cancer is still unclear. This study, identified a novel set of clinically relevant androgen-regulated lncRNAs in prostate cancer. Among this group, LINC00844 was demonstrated to be a direct androgen-regulated target that is actively transcribed in androgen receptor (AR)-dependent prostate cancer cells. The expression of LINC00844 is higher in normal prostate compared to malignant and metastatic prostate cancer clinical specimens and patients with low expression had a poor prognosis and significantly increased biochemical recurrence, suggesting LINC00844 functions in suppressing tumor progression and metastasis. Indeed, in vitro loss-of-function studies revealed that LINC00844 prevents prostate cancer cell migration and invasion. Moreover, findings from gene expression profiling analysis indicated that LINC00844 functions in trans, affecting global androgen-regulated gene transcription. Mechanistic evidence reveals that LINC00844 is important in facilitating AR binding to the chromatin. Finally, LINC00844 mediates its phenotypic effects in part by activating the expression of NDRG1, a crucial cancer metastasis suppressor. Collectively, LINC00844 is a novel coregulator of AR that plays a central role in the androgen transcriptional network and the development and progression of prostate cancer. Implications: This study highlights the function of the lncRNA, LINC00844, in regulating global AR-regulated genes in prostate cancer by modulating AR binding to chromatin. Received January 29, 2018.
