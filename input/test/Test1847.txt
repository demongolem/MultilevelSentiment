And in the process, they are finding that harassment and threats, already common for women,<br />can be amplified<br />in political races â€” especially if the candidate is a member of a minority group.<br />Image<br />Erin Schrode, 27, faced harassment during a congressional race in 2016. Threats continue to this day, she said.<br />Credit<br />Erika P. Rodriguez for The New York Times<br />Last year, sexist and anti-Semitic abuse helped drive Kim Weaver, an Iowa Democrat, out of her race against Representative<br />Steve King<br />.<br />Someone crept onto her property overnight and put up a â€œfor saleâ€� sign. The neo-Nazi website The Daily Stormer published an article (no longer available) titled, as Ms. Weaver recalled it, â€œMeet the Whore Whoâ€™s Running Against Steve King,â€� increasing what was already an onslaught of threats. An acquaintance in the German government even called to warn her about a threatening conversation on an extremist message board, and to ask if she had personal security.<br />â€œIâ€™m normally a pretty brave person, but when you feel like youâ€™re in a fishbowl and you donâ€™t know who it is thatâ€™s throwing rocks at you, itâ€™s disconcerting,â€� Ms. Weaver, 53, said. â€œYou donâ€™t know if itâ€™s somebody sitting in his motherâ€™s basement in Florida or if itâ€™s a gun-happy white supremacist who hates you who lives a block away.â€�<br />When she withdrew from the race, Mr. King suggested she had made up the threats. â€œI wanted #KimWeaver IN the race â€” not out,â€�<br />. â€œDemocrats drove her out of the race â€” not Râ€™s. Death threats likely didnâ€™t happen but a fabrication.â€�<br />No independent organization<br />appears to formally track incidents of harassment, and the Democratic and Republican National Committees did not respond to emails asking whether they did. But several groups that work with candidates said they routinely provided personal safety training.<br />Emily Ellsworth, 31, a Utah Republican, said that when she was seeking party delegatesâ€™ support to get on the ballot for the State Senate this year, a male delegate cornered her at multiple candidate meet-and-greets and messaged her around a dozen times on Facebook. Only after she<br />deactivated<br />her account did he stop.<br />The messages were not sexually explicit, she said, but made her feel that â€œhe really wanted to push a more personal relationship and had a hard time accepting the boundaries I had set.â€�<br />Morgan Zegers, 21, a Republican running for State Assembly in upstate New York, said she had been called a â€œG.O.P. Stepford wifeâ€� and often had to delete vulgar comments on her Facebook page. Lauren Underwood, 31,<br />a Democratic House candidate in Illinois<br />, recalled that when she was visiting a supporter, a local Republican stopped by and was affronted when he learned that Ms. Underwood was challenging his friend in Congress.<br />â€œHe threw his shoulders back and stood at his largest and leaned into me, as if he was going to launch at me for having the audacity to run for office,â€� Ms. Underwood said, adding that her supporter came to her defense.<br />Image<br />Morgan Zegers, a Republican running for state assembly in New York, said she has been harassed on social media.<br />Credit<br />Nathaniel Brooks for The New York Times<br />Harassment is not new for women in politics, or anywhere else â€” and men face it too, especially if they are African-American or Jewish. But for women, the harassment is ubiquitous and frequently sexualized, and it has come to the fore this election cycle, partly because so many women are running and partly because more of them are discussing their experiences.<br />Attendees at WomenWin â€” a forum<br />in June<br />for Democratic women running in Texas, which included a personal safety session led by the police chief of a local university â€” said they had found a sense of camaraderie in doing so.<br />â€œBeing in the room with all of those women that are having those same concerns as me made me feel so much saner,â€� said Samantha Carrillo Fields, 31, a candidate for the Texas House, referring not only to safety but also to other forms of misogyny on the campaign trail. â€œO.K., so this is real. What Iâ€™m feeling is real. It was really nice having that validation.â€�<br />In<br />a 2017 video by the Womenâ€™s Media Center<br />, elected officials â€” including seasoned politicians like Representatives Katherine M. Clark, 55, Democrat of Massachusetts, and Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, 66, Republican of Florida â€” described their experiences as part of a campaign called #NameItChangeIt, which encourages women to speak out about harassment. And women are more willing to do so than they were even a few years ago.<br />When Rebecca Thompson, a Democrat, ran for the Michigan House in 2014, strangers followed her home from events and drove slowly, repeatedly, past her house. At one point, someone broke into her car. By the end of the campaign, she said, she was sleeping at her partnerâ€™s house because she was afraid to be in her own.<br />â€œI felt unsafe throughout the entire campaign,â€� Ms. Thompson, 35, said. â€œIt almost seemed like psychological warfare, like they were trying to psych me out. It kept me on edge all the time, because I just didnâ€™t know where I could go, anywhere in the city, without feeling like I was being followed.â€�<br />But she was not comfortable speaking out then. â€œI told myself I had to just suck it up â€” thereâ€™s no crying in baseball; thereâ€™s no crying in politics,â€� she said. â€œHad those things happened now, I do feel like I would have been empowered to speak up about them.â€�<br />Yet even still, some candidates interviewed said initially that they had not been harassed â€” but then, when given examples like menacing social media messages, said yes, they had experienced those things. Just as many have observed in the #MeToo movement that a certain level of misogyny is so expected as to feel unremarkable, these candidates said they saw the messages as par for the course.<br />â€œIt becomes so normalized, the types of things that people say,â€� said Mya Whitaker, 27, a Democrat running for City Council in Oakland, Calif. â€œBeing a black woman and existing, in some cases, is enough to piss people off.â€�<br />Image<br />Mya Whitaker, a Democrat running for Oakland City Council. â€œBeing a black woman and existing, in some cases, is enough to piss people off," she said.<br />Credit<br />Cayce Clifford for The New York Times<br />A different kind of normalization happens at the other end of the spectrum, where the harassment is so vicious and constant that it overwhelms the ability to react.<br />As an independent video game developer in 2014, Brianna Wu was the subject of abuse<br />, when women involved in gaming were targeted for harassment.<br />Now a<br />Democrat running for Congress in Massachusetts<br />, Ms. Wu, 41, said death and rape threats came so routinely that she had ceased to feel much in response. Even when people threw objects through her window. Even when they vandalized her husbandâ€™s car. Even when they emailed paparazzi-like photos of her in her own home.<br />â€œI often look at it and Iâ€™m like: â€˜I know I should be feeling something right now. I know I should be feeling scared or angry or stressed.â€™ And itâ€™s at a point where I canâ€™t feel anything anymore,â€�<br />Ms. Wu<br />said. â€œItâ€™s almost like fear is a muscle that is so overtaxed, it can just do nothing else in my body.â€�<br />Many said it was a point of principle not to be intimidated into silence. Others said their political ideals were simply more important.<br />â€œFor good reason, thereâ€™s never any shortage of telling stories about women being harassed on the campaign trail,â€� Ms. Wu said. â€œBut I cannot communicate to you strongly enough: Over all, this job is fun. This job is exhausting, but this job is amazing.â€�<br />Image<br />Brianna Wu, a Democrat running for Congress in Massachusetts, said death and rape threats came so routinely that she had ceased to feel much in response.<br />Credit<br />Kayana Szymczak for The New York Times<br />Repeatedly, she and others urged prospective candidates not to be deterred. Ms. Zegers said that was why she deleted sexist Facebook comments.<br />â€œA lot of women pay attention to my page,â€� she said. â€œItâ€™s important to me that we show a good dialogue about the issues and we donâ€™t scare women away from running.â€�<br />And some cast the harassment as a<br />hurdle<br />they simply had to overcome if they wanted to change the systems that fuel it.<br />The government is still composed mainly of men who have never experienced sexual harassment, while â€œfar too many women experience these things,â€� Ms. Underwood said.<br />â€œI think thatâ€™s part of the opportunity in running for progress,â€� she said. â€œItâ€™s an opportunity to fix this and stop it from happening in the<br />future<br /
