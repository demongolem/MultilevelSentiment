Albayrak said the government aimed at making Turkey an investment center in the region.
"We are aware of recent fluctuations, challenges. We know our country's potential. We will emerge stronger with steps we will take," Albayrak said.
He said reducing inflation is Turkey's main priority.
"Monetary policy alone is not enough to fight inflation, we will back Central Bank with fiscal policies," Albayrak added.
"We have no second thoughts on fiscal discipline, and the government will prioritize structural reforms," he stated
