Source: FOX SPORTS The All Blacks perform the haka before game one of the Bledisloe Cup in 2017. Source: AAP FORMER All Blacks star Andrew Mehrtens believes peripheral aspects to the haka have become a "circus act" while a trio of former Wallabies have weighed in on what if feels like to face New Zealand's traditional pre-match rugby challenge.
The haka discussion on Fox Sports' Kick & Chase was triggered off the back of new book The Jersey , penned by British journalist Peter Bills.
In it former All Black Kees Meeuws was quoted as saying the haka had "lost its mana" and "become a showpiece" while the late, great Sir Colin Meads also slammed its overuse, saying "we were haka-ed out there for a while and still are."
A variety of All Blacks and Wallabies have since leapt to the haka's defence ahead of Saturday's opening Bledisloe Cup Test, including TJ Perenara and Will Genia.

Mehrtens, who labelled the haka as "too commercialised" in Bills' book, qualified his comments by stating the challenge was an important part of both New Zealand and All Black culture.
But the former five-eighth argued that it was an "indulgence" for New Zealanders and said opposition teams should be able to respond to their own liking.
In 2011, France were fined $5000 for advancing on the All Blacks' haka before the Rugby World Cup final.
"It's a challenge, it's laying down a challenge saying we're ready if you are," Mehrtens said.
"I still believe opposition teams should be free to receive that challenge how they like.
"I don't like the fact that there's 20, 30 metres between the two teams, cameras, microphones, photographers lying there taking shots.

"I think that part of it has become too much of a circus act.
"It's still important for us to do but it's important for us to do it in a way that says look, this is part of our culture but we realise it's an indulgence."
The Wallabies were bombarded by haka during the 2011 World Cup in New Zealand.
"Every time we hopped off a bus or a plane it was performed in front of us," former Wallabies winger Drew Mitchell said.
"For me, one of my greatest memories of playing against the All Blacks was facing the haka.
"I think it's a tremendous part of our game and it's very unique and I think the All Blacks, more than any other sporting team, from New Zealand, perform it the best.
"But I think it should be reserved for those Test matches and those sporting occasions and not outside of that.
"It shouldn't be commercialised â€” it is a challenge before a contest.
