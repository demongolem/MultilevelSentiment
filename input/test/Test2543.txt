OT: Letter from my MP On 16/08/2018 12:17, Bob Latham wrote: I wrote to my MP in April about what Ofcom described as a cross subsidy that BT levies from phone only customers to subsidise their broadband business. It was agreed between BT and Ofcom that this would be resolved by BT dropping their prices by around Ã‚Â£7 per month for phone only customers. However, as many of you know, it is not that straight forward because if you have broadband from Virgin you are not eligible for the Ã‚Â£7 discount and BT write to customers asking f they have broadband from other suppliers. This even though Virgin do not use BT lines for this. I wrote the email explaining this and pointed out the unfairness that broadband via satellite or mobile meant you could have the discount but via Virgin you cannot. I also raised the issue of BT writing to me about what I purchase from other suppliers which is none of their business. I have had a reply this morning. In her email she apologises for the delay in replying and says she completely understands my points and will raise the issue with the Minister responsible at the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy. I am a cynical old whatsit so my first thought is does this mean anything or is it just BS? Time will tell I suppose but I'm not expecting a good result even though logic and fairness appear to be on my side. Britain abandoned common sense decades ago. If you have broadband that does not use your metal telephone line, use VOIP and avoid paying BT or any other metal telephone line supplier any money at all - as I do. The added benefit is that calls are much cheaper. -
