As someone still working where he started his career as an intern, I'm a big believer in internships as ways to find paths into a career.
Today, I'm featuring another young person whose stint working with the National Park Service could also be a great career starter.
Casey Trout is a rising senior at Utah State University, and she spent this summer doing important research and collecting data on erosion of critical shorelines at George Washington's Birthplace National Monument.
From poring over historical maps and aerial photographs to wading out into Pope's Creek and the Potomac River to see erosion firsthand, Trout compiled a report for the staff that provides a good look at how storms, tides and simple rainfall are changing shorelines and bluffs there.
"She has done a really good job of putting that information together" said Melissa Cobern, the superintendent at the national park in Westmoreland County. "And it's been possible because of a great, relatively new program called Future Park Leaders of Emerging Change."
I caught up with the 21-year-old from Salt Lake City near the end of her stay at the Birthplace, after she'd been there for several months. She heard about the program from one of her academic academic advisers at Utah State, where she's majoring in environmental studies and statistic.
"It's a 3-year-old program that lets undergrads and graduate students work at different parks and in different areas of study," said Trout, who said she enjoyed getting to spend time on the East Coast after spending much of life in the West.
Trout said park staffers were extremely helpful, making her feel welcome and getting her started on the erosion project. She said it helped her learn how to deal and talk with other professionals in a way she hadn't had the chance to before.
Before long, she was digging deep into historical records, maps and photographs to get a handle on how erosion was progressing for shorelines in the park. She compiled data and addressed erosion all over the park, at one point working closely with a park service professional who did exact GPS mapping of shorelines at George Washington's Birthplace. Trout said it didn't take long to focus on two particular places in the park where shorelines were either receding rapidly or causing trees and sections of bluff to collapse into the water.
"One's a spit that extends back from the Potomac River into Pope's Creek, and the other is a section of the bluffs out on the river," she said.
She said the greatest loss was found on the spit, where the shoreline had receded some 30 feet over the past seven years.
"Records and reports indicate that much of that erosion happens when storms like Hurricane Isabel drive rainfall down the bluffs and waves up into the shoreline," said Trout.
More typical rainfall, tides and waves driven by river traffic also add to the erosion.
"You look at the aerial photographs and some of the islands that stood out years ago in Pope's Creek now are more like marshes, only visible at low tide," she said.
To get a first-hand look at the effects of the erosion, Trout said she went out and photographed trees toppled along the shore and parts of bluffs eaten away by wave action.
Trout said that she learned that the park service will not necessarily step in to halt erosion with large-scale preventative construction, as it's often the agency's approach to let naturally occurring changes continue, as long as that doesn't threaten the park or activities there.
She hopes that the information she pulled together might help park leaders make management decisions down the road.
"If they are interested in doing archaeology in areas that might be vulnerable to erosion, it might help make that a priority, or lead to something like improving culverts and drainage systems in other spots," she said.
Though Trout, who lived in Colonial Beach this summer, said she's not certain at this point about pursuing a career in the National Park Service, she does hope "to end up working in the natural resources field.
"This has really helped me to learn to work and deal with others in a professional setting," she said. "I was nervous about that when I started, but the folks here have been great and helped me to get over the nervousness I felt at the start. It's been a great experience."
