The international competition received a diverse collection of quality artwork from artists all around the world, including the US, Canada, United Kingdom, Australia, Germany, Japan, Taiwan, Israel, Belgium and South Africa. The exhibition will be featured on the Fusion Art website for the month of August 2018.
Founded by Award winning artist, Chris and Valerie Hoffman, Fusion Art was envisioned and formed out of a passion for art and the artists who create it. The website promotes and connects new, emerging and established artists with collectors and art enthusiasts, while offering the opportunity to participate in art competitions, exhibitions and experiences.
Each month and quarter Fusion Art hosts uniquely themed solo and group art competitions and exhibitions. Both winners and finalists are provided with worldwide exposure, by having their work promoted through Fusion Art's website, in hundreds of press release announcements, email marketing, online event calendars, art news websites and through the gallery's social media outlets. The gallery's objective is to promote the artists, worldwide, to art professionals, gallerists, collectors and buyers.
