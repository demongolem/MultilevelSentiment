"Nashville" Bids Farewell After Six Seasons BY BLOUIN ARTINFO | August 17, 2018 (Courtesy: Instagram and nashvillecmt) "Nashville" finally ends after six seasons, 124 episodes, and 13 soundtrack albums. The show first premiered on ABC in 2012 and was shot completely in Nashville, Tennessee. It focussed mostly on the country music industry and is often regarded as a transformative force that made the fans fall in love with its characters and songs. Stars of the show, Clare Bowen and Charles Esten said their final lines as Scarlett and Deacon. "Everyone was standing there, waiting for us to say something," Bowen told USAToday . "And I didn't know what to say except 'Thank you. I love you all.' Because they're my family." "Nashville" opened to positive reviews from critics but the popularity of the show starting falling over the years. At the end of season four, there were talks of cancellation too. But the show was saved by rallying by fans (known as "Nashies,") and cable network CMT stepped in to keep the show alive for two more seasons. Even before season 6 started, the producers made an announcement that this would be indeed the last season, which according to the executive producer Marshall Herskovitz is "a gift." "We could really plan a final season, and a finale that would do justice to the characters," he told USAToday . "I think the whole season was about preparing for that." But not all were prepared for the surprise "farewell" episode "Nashville" aired last year â€“ with the sudden death of lead protagonist Rayna Jaymes, played by series star Connie Britton. Herskovitz also added that the final season was more about "the human drama that people could relate to in their own lives." Though many of the show's stars have bought homes in Nashville and plan to stay, new acting gigs are beginning to pull them elsewhere. Esten will be featuring in the upcoming TNT drama "Tell Me Your Secrets," which films in New Orleans. Bowen is reconnecting with an industry community in she'd just started to get to know before "Nashville" changed her life
