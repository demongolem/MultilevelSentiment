Yoga The Common Myths About MS: Busted!
Multiple sclerosis is a fairly misunderstood disease. For many people, this name is affiliated with scary things like permanent disability, and wheelchairs and walkers. However, according to healthcentral.com's MS expert, Lisa Emrich, the truth about MS is that it is actually a fairly manageable disease. Many people who are suffering from this disease are able to have control over it and they are able to live active, and fulfilling lives. Over the years there have been many rumors and myths that have surface across the internet about this disease. So here are some of the myths, debunked! First Things First, What is MS?
Multiple sclerosis, known as MS, is a long-lasting disease that can affect your brain, spinal cord, and the optic nerves within your eyes. It can result in problems with vision, balance, muscle control, and other basic bodily functions. The effects differ from everyone who has the disease, while some may not need treatment, others will have trouble doing daily tasks or getting around. When Does MS Happen?
MS Occurs when your immune system attacks a fatty material called myelin, which wraps around your nerve fibers to protect them. Without this outer shell, your nerves become damaged and scar tissue forms. The damage means that your brain is unable to send signals through your body correctly. Your nerves also don't work in the order they should in order to help you move and feel things. Your Immune System Goes Awry
MS is an auto-immune condition. Doctors are unsure as to why, but there is something within your immune system that says to attack your body. You might be more likely to get MS if you have other autoimmune conditions like inflammatory bowel disease, thyroid disease, or type 1 diabetes. ADVERTISEMENT Diagnosed
People are often diagnosed with MS between the ages of 20 and 40. After being diagnoses, the symptoms tend to get better, but then they often come back. The symptoms may come and go for others, but some may linger. No two cases of MS are the same. Some people may only have a single symptom, and then go months or years without any others. One small problem can occur just once and then go away, and never return. For others, however, the symptoms get worse within the coming weeks and months. Early Signs of MS
For many people, the first brush of MS occurs with CIS (or clinically isolated syndrome). This is an episode of neurological symptoms that onlyy occurs for 24 hours. There are two types of CIS, monofocal episode, which is when you have only one symptom, and multifocal episode, when you have more than one symptom. The Myths: Multiple Sclerosis is a Fatal Disease
MS is really not considered a fatal disease. Statistics have shown that many people who suffer from MS have a very normal life span. The deaths that are associated with the disease are the cause of complications in advanced, progressive stages of MS. The goal of early treatment is to slow down the disease progression and help prevent complications. However, very severe cases of the disease can indeed shorten a patient's life. There is No Treatment for MS
This is actually wrong. While there is no cure for MS, there are many treatments available that assist patients in managing the disease and the symptoms that it causes. In November 2016, it was announced that there are fourteen FDA-approved medications that have been shown to change or slow down the course of the disease. These medications consist of three oral drugs, three infusion therapies, and eight injectables. ADVERTISEMENT Everyone with MS Ends Up in a Wheelchair
This is not true at all. Many people living with MS are able to walk without assistance, and it is a very small number of sufferers that end up needing walking assistance. Only 25 percent of people with MS use a wheelchair or stay in bed because they are unable to walk. This statistic was also discovered before the new disease-modifying drugs were available. MS isn't a Physically Painful Condition
Often times people assume that sufferers of the disease experience numbness and mobility issues, but that doesn't mean that they don't feel physical pain as well. One study claims that up to 55 percent of MS patients experienced clinically significant pain, whether acute or chronic, at some point during their experience. People Diagnosed with MS Must Go On Disability
There really isn't any scientific evidence that states that the normal stress of working has any effect on people with MS. However the symptoms, that include fatigue, may need to be managed while working on the job. 30 percent of people with MS are working full time after 20 years with the disease. People with MS Shouldn't Have Children
Pregnancy and childbirth have been proven to have no long-term effect on MS. In fact, many women have said that their symptoms diminish while pregnant, which is why estriol is being studied as a potential MS treatment. However, the risk of an MS relapse increases in the six months after delivery. Yet, there's no reason why women with MS can't give birth or be a fantastic parent to their children.

Although it is true that sufferers of MS in the United States are predominantly white, that doesn't mean it only affects Caucasians. According to a study supported by the National MS Society, African Americans with the condition are more likely to experience an aggressive course of the disease. MS is Caused By Heavy Metals or Diet
Although scientists have yet to identify one single cause for MS, they have concluded that it's not the result of a poor diet, negative attitude, or heavy metal poisoning from dental fillings or other environmental sources. Data suggests that MS is caused by a combination of environmental and genetic factors, and some studies say that hormones and certain viruses pay a role as well. Natural Treatments are 'Safer' and More Effective Than Prescriptions
There's much controversy surrounding alternative approaches to treating MS. Advocates of alternative forms of medication say that the conventional ways are ignoring or suppressing treatments that can ease symptoms or even cure some diseases. Opponents want patients to stick to treatments proven to be both safe and effective. MS is Easy To Diagnose
It isn't really. Actually it can take anything from months to years for an accurate diagnosis to be made. The current diagnostic criteria makes it easier to catch symptoms, but it still requires that evidence of demyelination is seen at two points in time and in different locations within the central nervous system. This can take some time. ADVERTISEMENT "No One Will Love Me Now That I Have MS"
Actually, confronting the challenges of MS may make many couples closer than ever. Talking about the problems and developing solutions together can deepen both partners' sense of intimacy. With situations of MS, sexuality does not have to disappear from the lives of couples when a partner has MS. No One Can Possibly Understand What I'm Going Through About 400,000 Americans acknowledge having and suffering from MS, and every week over 200 people are diagnosed. Worldwide, MS may affect 2.5 million individuals. Scientists Aren't Making Much Progress in the Fight Against MS
This is extremely false. The nationalMSSociety.org claims, "There has never been a more exciting time in MS research. Until 1993 there were no medicines that could alter the underlying disease, and now there are six approved drugs for different forms of MS. The National MS Society is spending $ 40 million every year to fight MS, including funding more than 3 50 in-depth investigations into virtually every aspect of this disease."

Although it's not completely necessary, people with milder symptoms should still consider treatment. A study published in December 2013 in the journal Acta Neuropathologica Communications agreed with early treatment for the prevention of long-term nerve cell damage. MS Relapses Don't Affect Cognitive Dysfunction
An MS relapse can actually interfere with your ability to think clearly or find the right words. About half of all people with MS have chronic short-term memory loss or multi-tasking problems. Occupational therapy, workplace accommodations, and organizational skills can help you cope
