David worked as a handyman-type job doing seasonal work at the council.
A colleague said he had "always been a good team player" and that he had told colleagues he was "heartbroken" after Carol said she'd had an affair two decades before.
She said Carol had told David before that she would take her own life if he left her.
After her death, she said he was "an emotional wreck" and that "the once bullish man was gone".
"He explained how guilty he felt. We all commented that we were worried for his wellbeing."
She said his loss had "devastated the entire team". 11:51 'I've been arrested for murder but I'm not a murderer'
Another friend of David's is now giving evidence.
She said David "thought the world of Carol" but had told her he hit Carol and given her a black eye.
He had "fixated on the affair" and on the night of Carol's death had tried to split up with her. Carol then said she didn't want to live without him and would kill herself. David then said "go on then" and she killed herself.
Four days after Carol's death, the friend said David called and said he'd been arrested for murder "but wasn't a murderer".
He went onto say: "I miss her so much and keep looking at old photos, I just don't know how I can cope.
"I've got no family and nothing to live for." 11:46 Friend says David was 'depressed'
A friend of the couple is now having a statement read out in court.
"David was devastated at the loss of Carol and was drinking heavily," he said.
"David said I can't deal with it, I hope god will give me a heart attack, so then I can be back with Carol.
"Dave was depressed, drinking a lot and using it as his solace. He was drinking on a daily basis." 11:39 'Both David and Carol had it all to live for' Carol Camm died in tragic circumstances
Carol Camm's mother, Margaret, has had her statement read out at Hull Coroner's Court.
She has told how the couple had been together since they were teenagers and that Carol had rung her in the months before her death saying David wanted to leave her.
She said the last time she saw David was at the mortuary after Carol's death, where he told her he had been drinking heavily and couldn't live without Carol.
"Both Carol and David had it all to live for and I can't believe what happened," she said. 11:31 'He promised me he wouldn't do it'
The neighbour said Mr Palmer tried to leave his house a couple of times, and told him "I need to go back to my dog, he's the only one who loves me now".
"He had told me he hadn't changed the sheets since Carol's death so that he could still smell her," the neighbour said.
"He told me that he wanted to end his life in the same way Carol did.
"I asked him to promise me that he wouldn't do it. He promised me that he wouldn't do it." 11:29 KEY EVENT 'I don't want to be here anymore' Main street, Buckton near Bridlington, where a 52-year-old woman was found dead on December 19. (Image: Katie Pugh)

"After Carol's death he slept on the floor where Carol died and drank alcohol to get to sleep," he told the court.

The neighbour said he also "heard a loud bang and shouting" from the couple's home on a couple of occasions. 11:18 'They were both very heavy drinkers' The home of Carol Camm and David Palmer
A neighbour of Mr Palmer said he knew him for more than 20 years.
Mr Palmer and his partner, Miss Camm, ran the Cricketer's and the Nags Head in Bridlington, where his neighbour said he first met them.

The inquest has heard Mr Palmer had 3.5 times the amount of alcohol in his blood than would be considered legal for drink-driving.

Dr Karsai said the amount was "very high by any standards" and would "certainly have affected his judgement". 10:50 David started drinking heavily after Miss Camm's death
The inquest has heard David had started drinking heavily after Miss Camm's death in December last year.

Speaking at Miss Camm's inquest two weeks ago, Detective Constable Claire Jackson, from Humberside Police's Major Crime Team, saod a full investigation took place following Miss Camm's death but there was not enough evidence to charge Mr Palmer with any offence.
