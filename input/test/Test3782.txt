According to a Reuters report, Amazon is sounding out some of Europe's top insurance firms to find out if they would contribute products to a UK price comparison website. This would be a major step by the US online retail giant into the region's financial services market and one which has been much feared.
Three industry executives told Reuters they had held talks with Amazon about the possible launch of a site. One said the talks were part of several discussions Amazon is having with insurers. A second said there were no imminent launch plans.
While it was not immediately clear what type of insurance would be sold on any Amazon site, home and motor policies are popular sellers on existing UK price comparison sites.
Stuart Rye, Director of Business Development, Financial Services at Fujitsu , said: "This has the potential to be the major industry shake-up both feared and expected by many. An Amazon price comparison website for insurance products could challenge existing UK products given the company's cutting-edge technology, reach and loyal customer base. But in this instance, Amazon is well-placed to shake up comparison websites â€“ often, these do not prioritise customer needs and fail to include all insurance firms, meaning the prices listed are not necessarily the lowest, This is detrimental to both customers and insurance firm. Amazon, however, certainly has the experience in customer data analysis and the ability to create additional value by connecting this to their development of home and life services with Alexa.
"Given the busy UK market, the question is whether Amazon can actually disrupt existing aggregators. As the insurance aggregation market in the UK is already pretty mature, very competitive, rapidly evolving and improving, driven by digital native tech companies, other companies â€“ such as Tesco and Google â€“ have tried and failed before. If Amazon has any unique value over them, this is more likely to come not from technical prowess but from value chain integration, given the digital depth and breadth of Amazon.
"The truth is, despite the changes to date, the insurance industry is only at the start of its own transformation. So far, the industry's response to changing customer behaviour and demand for digital offerings has been automation of typically slow processes, creating mobile apps and investing in chatbots. The digital age has ushered an incredible opportunity for insurers to evolve the very purpose of the industry â€“by challenging their mindset and shifting their business to focus on prevention, rather than the reaction to an incident."
The industry sources declined to be named as the talks are confidential. Amazon declined to comment
