Split of NNPC may create tension among workers â€“ Baru
Published Tweet
The Group Managing Director of the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation, NNPC, Dr Maikanti Baru, has warned that the split of the corporation into two entities could generate some tension between the unions in the corporation if not properly managed.
Baru noted that the Petroleum Industry Governance Bill, recently passed by the National Assembly, required the minister to within six months after its enactment take necessary steps to incorporate the entities, namely the Nigerian Petroleum Assets Management Company and the Nigeria Petroleum Company, as companies limited by shares to be vested with certain liabilities and assets of the NNPC.
"The current National Assembly identified the bogus packaging of the Petroleum Industry Bill as a single legal instrument as a major hindrance to its passage and decided to present a number of smaller, more detailed bills," he said in Lagos at the annual conference of the Association of Energy Correspondents of Nigeria.
The PIB was split into four parts â€“ PIGB, Petroleum Industry Administration Bill, Petroleum Industry Fiscal Bill and Petroleum Host Community Bill.
According to him, the PIGB seeks to create an avenue for better investment opportunities, make the petroleum sector more transparent and ensure better accountability of revenue derived from the nation's vast oil and gas resources.
On the split of the NNPC, Baru said, "Engagement with staff and consultation with individuals and establishment with institutional memory of how the issue of staff movement was handled when the DPR was expunged from the NNPC is necessary."
He noted that the initial shares of the NNPC would be held by the Ministry of Petroleum Incorporated (40 per cent), the Ministry of Finance Incorporated (40 per cent) and the Bureau of Public Enterprises (20 per cent).
The GMD added, "However, 10 per cent and an additional 30 per cent of the shares of the company shall be floated on the Nigerian Stock Exchange within five yearsand 10 years from incorporation, respectively.
"On the issue of divestment of 40 per cent of the NNPC shares to the Nigerian Stock Exchange, there is a need for clarity on the process of the divestment and the steps should be clearly provided in the law.
"There is a need for clarity regarding the nature of the NNPC liability to be transferred to the Nigeria Petroleum Liability Management Company, asides from outstanding pension obligations of the DPR. There is a need to provide adequate clarity on the type and nature of liability to be inherited and the process for the settlement of such liability."

Published
Chairman of the All Progressives Congress (APC), in Yobe State, Alhaji Adamu Chilariye has accused the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) of illegally buying the permanent voter's card (PVC) of unsuspecting members of the public.
He made the accusation on Thursday at a press briefing in Damaturu.
Chilariye stated that the state exco of the APC was notified of the development.
"The PDP political office holders in Yobe Zone B have been using surrogates to purchase voter's cards within Potiskum town at the cost of N5000 per PVC," he alleged.
He disclosed that the APC has lodged complaints with the security agencies against the illegal act.
Chilariye advised the general public to be careful not to fall into the politicians' trap.
The chairman disassociated SEC from some political aspirants in APC who had begun to deceive members of the party that they were endorsed by the SEC.
"The SEC wishes to state that it has no anointed aspirant and will only support the candidate that emerges as the party's flag bearer during primaries", he said. Share this: 2019: Buhari speaks on 'interfering' with elections
Published TGN
Ahead of the 2019 elections, President Muhammadu Buhari on Thursday promised that the poll will be free and fair.
He promised not to interfere with the activities of the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) before, during and after the elections.
Buhari's Special Adviser on Political Matters, Senator Babafemi Ojodu, said this while reading the President's speech at the 2018 Annual Nigeria Political Parties' summit held in Abuja.
"Today, I pledge to Nigeria, my country to promote free fair and credible election devoid of any form of interference in the activities of INEC, to ensure security and promote a violence free election devoid of animosity and hate speeches, to abide by the extant laws governing political parties and adhere strictly to the code of conduct of political parties in Nigeria. So help me God," he said.
He assured Nigerians of a violent free election in 2019.
"What has brought us together is our strong desire to build a budding democracy through a peaceful 2019 general election. No matter the nature and level of our political influences, we do not have another nation than Nigeria. These differences should not divide us but should make us stronger. With commitment and perseverance, we will triumph.
"On our part, I want to reassure the nation that this administration is committed to a democratic process characterized by free, fair and credible election. We are committed to providing an enabling environment and a level playing ground for all political parties in the electioneering process without hindrance.
"Democracy is not an event, but a process to ensure that power is always exercised on behalf of the people by their representatives. It is the political parties that carefully select and present candidates for the electorates to choose from, while the elections present the opportunity for the people to make their choices freely through a free and fair contest devoid of violence, intimidation, hate speeches and blackmail.
"Let me emphasise here that electioneering must be approached with the highest level of decorum and strict adherence to the rules of the game, particularly as enshrined in the constitution, the electoral act and indeed the code of conduct which the political parties freely put in place.
"Electioneering must never be seen as a do or die. All over the world, developed and developing, we see nations making huge successes of their electioneering and Nigeria must not be an exception in this global trend of peaceful and transparent election,'' he said. Share this: Baraje reveals only way Saraki can be impeached
Published TGN
Kawu Baraje, a former leader of the Reformed All Progressives Congress, R-APC, who decamped to the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, on Thursday, has spoken on the plans to impeach the Senate President, Bukola Saraki.
Baraje said it is two-thirds of the entire 109 senators that can impeach Saraki and not two third of the Senators that are present on the day of any planned impeachment.
He said this while addressing journalists in Ilorin, the Kwara State capital.
According to Baraje, "I am not a senator, but I am a party leader and a politician. As a politician, you don't just sit down without educating yourself. I have read the Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria. Whenever there is any controversy about any issue, I read the constitution.
"I have gone through the relevant section,s particularly on the issue of impeachment. The constitution makes me understand that only senators can elect their president and also only senators can impeach their President. The constitution also stipulates the offences he must have committed to be impeached. Having seen the offences committed, they will go into votes.
"Two third of the entire 109 senators not two third of the senators that are present on the day of the impeachment. It is because of the background of some us that we do not talk too much. Because we believe that we should listen more rather than talking more.
"There is a lot of respect in listening more. The fact that we listen more does not mean we do not know our rights. There are so many things being said on this issue of impeachment that is insulting the sensibilities of Nigerians particularly those of us that can read and right.
"It is most unfortunate that somebody will just come up to talk of impeachment as if we are in a banana republic. Some of us have experiences of leading political parties and if issues like these come up we know how to handle them. It needs a lot of patience, exposure, a lot of education and cool-headedness.
"It is not by Gestapo approach. In any case, the senators are making Nigerians realise through their body language that as far as they are concerned they are not ready to impeach their president.
"Any sensible leader should have understood that language that the senators are not going the way some people want to go; which is the way of causing confusion between the executive and the legislature. The present situation exists between the executive and the legislature was caused by some people who do not want the two arms to work together because they will never gain out of it." Share this
