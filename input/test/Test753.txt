A New Swimming Pool for Hadleigh is one-step closure

The new pool plans have been submitted and can be viewed online at the Babergh planning portal.

The design team have addressed all of the points raised during public consultation and we are delighted to confirm that the pool will be 0.9metres deep at the shallow end increasing to 1.8metre at its deepest point. This will allow those learning to swim to also learn to dive.
The new facility will also include a Changing Places Toilet. Research has found that over a quarter of a million severely disabled people, including those with profound and multiple learning disabilities do not have access to public toilet facilities that meet their needs. In the UK the number of people who would benefit from a Changing Places Toilet would include approximately: 230,000, whilst we do not have that many residents in Hadleigh we have a high level of older users and this facility will offer greater access to those with disability. Hadleigh does not currently have a changing places toilet and as part of this project and our commitment to equality, we have included this facility in the new pool. This facility will be publically accessible.
A sauna has also been incorporated into the plans.
If all goes to plan the work on the new pool will start in the New Year. The anticipated opening date for swimmers will be January 2020.
Cllr Margaret Maybury, Cabinet Member for Communities at Babergh District Council said, "This project is an exciting development for Hadleigh and its surrounding district as a new pool has been a dream of many for a long time. Babergh are committed to enhancing wellbeing facilities for all ages and the new pool project promotes this. We have a long way to go; securing planning approval is the first step. I wish all at SSL every success in their endeavours and we at Babergh are behind them every step of the way."
Cllr Peter Matthews, Mayor of Hadleigh Town Council said "This is indeed an exciting move forwards that will provide a much needed upgrade to the current facility, and ensure that our residents of all ages can use and enjoy the benefits of swimming for many more years to come."
