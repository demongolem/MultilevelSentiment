Joining the Thermal Orange Pearl exterior, optional carbon ceramic metallic (CCM) brakes can now be fitted with orange calipers. New for 2019, the standard iron brakes can now be fitted with red calipers.<br />All 2019 NSX models are distinguished by a new body-color front grille garnish (previously silver) and high-gloss treatments for the front grille surround, front air intake mesh and rear bumper outlet mesh. High-gloss treatment is also applied to the available Carbon Fiber Decklid Spoiler and Carbon Fiber Exterior Package â€“ including a front chin spoiler, side sill garnish and rear diffuser.<br />Inside the cockpit, the 2019 NSX color palette is expanded with the addition of an optional Indigo blue Semi-aniline leather and Alcantara<br />Â®<br />theme. The available semi-aniline full leather (non-Alcantara) power sport seats can now be optioned in Red in addition to Ebony. Power sport seats (4-way), previously a<br />$1,500<br />option, are now standard equipment. Lightweight manually adjustable sport seats, wrapped in Black Milano leather and Alcantara, remain an available no-cost option. Satellite-Linked Navigation, ELS Studio<br />Â®<br />premium audio, front and rear proximity sensors and aluminum sport pedals, previously optional equipment, are now standard.<br />Dynamics Enhancements<br />For the 2019 model, engineers modified chassis components, tires and software tuning to make NSX even more responsive to the will of the driver, elevating performance driving in all circumstances, from daily driving to the circuit.  At the limit, the NSX's balance, playfulness and controllability has improved, allowing the driver to more precisely modulate understeer and oversteer with subtle throttle inputs. The changes resulted in a nearly 2-second faster lap time in testing around the world famous Suzuka Circuit.<br />Chassis enhancements include larger front and rear stabilizer bars (increasing stiffness by 26 percent in front, 19 percent at the rear) and 21 percent stiffer rear toe link bushings. Rear hub rigidity has increased 6 percent. Software calibrations to the NSX's Sport Hybrid SH-AWD<br />Â®<br />power unit, active magnetorheological dampers, electric power steering and VSA settings capitalize on this new hardware, as well as the grippier tire setup.<br />The 2019 NSX rides on new Continental SportContactâ„¢ 6 tires, developed exclusively for the NSX. The new tires (replacing Continental ContiSportContactâ„¢ 5P) feature a revised tread pattern, construction and rubber compound for improved handling performance in all conditionsâ€”from daily commuting to track useâ€”including wet weather driving. The track-focused Pirelli P Zeroâ„¢ Trofeo R remains an optional dealer-installed tire.<br />Electrifying Sport Hybrid SH-AWD<br /
