More than 2,000 drivers caught speeding during one week in police crackdown Menu More than 2,000 drivers caught speeding during one week in police crackdown More than 2,000 drivers caught speeding in one week 0 comments MORE than 2,000 drivers were caught speeding across Hampshire and Isle of Wight as part of a seven day enforcement operation by police last week.
A total of 2,007 people were driving over the speed limit, 75 per cent of which were in 30mph areas where there are 'greater hazards' and a number of different road users, police have warned.
Road policing officers stopped and dealt with 162 people, and nearly half of those caught have been offered a National Speed Awareness course as an alternative to prosecution.
Police chiefs say their focus for those who endanger lives of the road is through enforcement and education.
Sgt Rob Heard, from the Joint Operations Roads Policing Unit, said: "Research from across Europe suggests speeding is the most important factor that contributes to road deaths and serious injuries.
"The results in the space of just one week show that too many people are putting their lives in danger on our roads.
"Excessive or inappropriate speed has an appalling impact when you're involved in a collision."
Out of those caught during the week, 70 per cent were male and 71 per cent were over 25 years old.
Nearly all speeders, at 92 per cent, were car drivers.
Sgt Heard added: "If you collide with a pedestrian at 30mph they have an 80 per cent chance of survival, however if you collide at 40mph then the pedestrian only has a 10 per cent chance of survival.
"This is why it forms one of our Fatal Four.
"Our message is simple, It's not worth the risk and you massively reduce the chances of you avoiding a collision when an unexpected hazard occurs in front of you.
