Now you can buy and sell Ethereum Classic on Coinbase 17 Aug, 2018 News Share
Dan Romero, Vice President and GM of Coinbase Consumer, announced on the Coinbase blog , that they now support Ethereum Classic on Coinbase.com and their mobile app.
Romero added that from now on, their customers in every country where Coinbase operates can now log in to buy, sell, send, receive, or store Ethereum Classic, along with Bitcoin, Bitcoin Cash, Ethereum, and Litecoin.
Coinbase made the announcement of adding Ethereum Classic onto Coinbase Pro already in the beginning of July, however, criticism about the way it added Bitcoin Cash last year, could be the reason why Coinbase took more then a month to implement ETC.
Today Coinbase offers 5 coins, but that's likely to change later this year.
"We announced last month that we are exploring a number of other assets to add to the platform. We hear your requests, and are working hard to make more assets available to more customers around the world." Romero said. As 5pm PT, Coinbase Consumer now supports Ethereum Classic (ETC) across its products, including https://t.co/bCG11KveHS and the mobile app. https://t.co/VokLVW6kRf pic.twitter.com/ciJWxr1p9
