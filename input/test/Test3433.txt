Hi, Spring fans! Welcome to another installment of This Week in Spring ! This week, I'm in San Francisco, Seattle, and Los Angeles talking to customers.
We on the Spring team are heads down, preparing for this year's top event-to-not-miss, SpringOne Platform . Come to learn more about cloud-native application development, cloud computing, agile, DevOps, big data, continuous-delivery, testing, and so much more. Get your tickets now! The event is September 24-27th, 2018, in Washington, D.C.

It's been an absolutely crazy week, so let's get to it!
First, let's take a look at how the Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA) has moved to change how they manage operating systems. One of the side-effects of this change is a new certification â€” Ubuntu from Canonical. This has a lot of profound implications for Cloud Foundry. Click here to read more!

Many of the videos are unique, of course, but some are duplicates. Either way, you might find the content videos worthwhile. It was interesting to me to think that there's enough content out there to keep watching a talk a day for more than three months! Also, there's a lot of other great content on that portal from other speakers. So, again, worth a visit
