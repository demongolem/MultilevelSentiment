As of late, it has definitely been a great time to be an investor in Amedisys, Inc. AMED . The stock has moved higher by 22.5% in the past month, while it is also above its 20 Day SMA too. This combination of strong price performance and favorable technical, could suggest that the stock may be on the right path.
We certainly think that this might be the case, particularly if you consider AMED's recent earnings estimate revision activity. From this look, the company's future is quite favorable; as AMED has earned itself a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), meaning that its recent run may continue for a bit longer, and that this isn't the top for the in-focus company.

With battery prices plummeting and charging stations set to multiply, one company stands out as the #1 stock to buy according to Zacks research.
It's not the one you think.
