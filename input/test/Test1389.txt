The Freedom Bottle Program has raised more than<br />$750,000<br />over the past five years for Lone Survivor Foundation's mission to restore, empower, and renew hope for wounded veterans and their families through health, wellness, and therapeutic support. During that time, over 800 veterans and military family members have attended LSF's therapeutic retreat programs, thanks in large part to RumChata's generous support.<br />&quot;The RumChata Foundation is proud to support the Lone Survivor Foundation through its annual Freedom Bottle Program,&quot; said<br />Tom Maas<br />, RumChata Founder and Master Blender. &quot;We are excited to see the funding being put to work for our veterans and their families and provide great LSF programs to support their lives.&quot;<br />&quot;During LSF's progressive retreat program, we empower our participants with the skills and resources necessary to take ownership of their healing process and experience improved quality of life, which would not be possible without the support of organizations like the Rumchata Foundation. We are very grateful for the RumChata Foundation's continued support of LSF's mission and our nation's veterans,&quot; said<br />Kevin Barber<br /
