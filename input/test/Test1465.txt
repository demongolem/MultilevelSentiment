Bevespi Aerosphere is claimed to be the first and only LAMA/LABA with Aerosphere delivery technology.<br />The 24-week Aeristo phase IIIb study was a randomised, double-blinded, double-dummy, multicentre and parallel-group trial designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of Bevespi Aerosphere against umeclidinium/vilanterol.<br />According to the company, the trialâ€™s primary endpoints were peak change from baseline in FEV1 where non-inferiority and superiority were measured and change from baseline in trough FEV1 where non-inferiority was measured.<br />The company randomized 1,119 patients in the study to receive either two inhalations twice a day of Bevespi Aerosphere (glycopyrronium/formoterol fumarate 7.2/4.8Âµg) through pressurised metered-dose inhaler or one inhalation once a day of umeclidinium/vilanterol 62.5/25Âµg via dry powder inhaler.<br />Bevespi Aerosphere already approved in the US and Canada for the long-term maintenance treatment of airflow obstruction in COPD.<br />At present, it is being reviewed by the European Medicines Agency and regulatory decision is expected in the second half of this year.<br />Bevespi Aerosphere is approved in the US and Canada for the long-term maintenance treatment of airflow obstruction in COPD. Bevespi Aerosphere is currently under review by the European Medicines Agency with a regulatory decision anticipated in the second half of 2018.<br />AstraZeneca<br />respiratory global medicines development head Dr Colin Reisner said: â€œThe efficacy and safety of Bevespi Aerosphere has been established by the Phase III PINNACLE trial programme involving more than 5,000 patients.<br />The performance of Bevespi Aerosphere in AERISTO is inconsistent with previous data. A full analysis is underway to understand and characterise these findings and will be presented at a forthcoming medical meeting.â€�<br />Related<br />Do you have interesting content to share with us?<br />Enter your email address so we can get in touch.<br /></form><br /
