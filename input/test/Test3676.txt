Down East Wood Ducks News Release
KINSTON, NC - The final "Throwback Thursday" ended with a dud in the Woodies' 2-1 loss to the Mudcats. Anderson Tejeda had two of the four hits for the "K-Tribe" but it was too late to support Rollie Lacy's seven shutout innings on the mound.
The right-hander matched a career-high with seven innings on the mound and also struck out six batters. He took a no decision since the game was still scoreless when he exited. Lacy also induced nine groundouts of the 12 in-play outs against him.
Both offense were cold for the first two-thirds of the game, stuck on one hit for the first six innings. Devin Williams started for the Mudcats but exited on a pitch count in the fourth inning. His replacement, Victor Diaz, cruised until the eighth inning.
However in the top of the frame, the Mudcats put two aboard against Sal Mendez with walks. With two outs and a 3-2 count, Weston Wilson doubled down the left field line to score a pair to put the Mudcats ahead.
Down East responded in the bottom of the inning by putting runners on first and second with two outs for Tejeda. He lined a 2-2 double to right field to bring in Brendon Davis from second. LeDarious Clark, running from first, got the wave in from Spike Owen but a perfect relay nabbed him at the plate to end the inning.
The Woodies would go down 1-2-3 in the ninth to drop the finale. With the loss, the Wood Ducks finish their home slate with the Mudcats nearly perfect at 8-1. On the downside, they only managed a 2-6 record wearing the Kinston Indians jerseys this season.
The DEWDs hit the road for the next six games for their only trips to Salem and Wilmington on the season. Three games with the Red Sox over the weekend begin at 7:05 on Friday night from Haley Toyota Field
