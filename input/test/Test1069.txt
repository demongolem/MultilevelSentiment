Epileptic Seizure Monitor Alarm System Market Progresses for Huge Profits by the End 2026
Albany, NY -- ( SBWIRE ) -- 08/17/2018 -- Epileptic seizures are triggered due to disturbances in the neural activity of the brain. There are many different types of epileptic seizures. Seizures can be triggered due to hypoglycemia (low blood sugar levels. In certain cases, young children experience febrile convulsions when they are running a temperature. In March 2017 the International League Against Epilepsy (ILAE) presented a new method to classify seizures. The new classification provides doctors with a more accurate diagnosis of seizures for appropriate treatment. Seizures are classified on the basis of the following points: where they start in the brain, whether or not the affected individual's awareness, and are there any other symptoms associated with seizures. Different types of epileptic seizures are focal and generalized, focal aware seizure (FAS), tonic clonic seizure, atonic seizure, focal impaired awareness seizure (FIAS), myoclonic seizure, and absence seizure. Currently, the treatment of epileptic seizures comprises of anti-epileptic drugs, ketogenic diet, vagus nerve stimulation, epilepsy surgery, and deep brain stimulation. An epileptic seizure monitor alarm system provides assistance in reporting the onset of seizure to the caregiver. Monitoring alarm systems are available, which are capable of detecting tonic-clonic seizures or focal motor seizures with adequate body movements. Epileptic seizure monitor alarm systems alert nearby caregivers when a seizure is detected through alarms, phone calls, or text message, depending on the device. The caregiver can thus help reposition the person and make sure that the individual does not lose consciousness. In case breathing problems occur, the caregiver can call for medical emergency services or provide rescue medications if the individual has repeated seizures.
