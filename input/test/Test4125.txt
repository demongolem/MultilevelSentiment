Police have released further details of two community events next weekend aimed at tackling bike theft in a Staffordshire town - and reuniting victims with their possessions.
There has been an ongoing issue with bicycles being stolen in Stafford - with research by StokeonTrentLive showing more than 150 were stolen in the county town the first six months of 2018.
Last week police launched a crackdown on bike theft in the area - arresting a number of suspected thieves and announcing plans to host an event to reunite dozens of stolen bikes with their rightful owners.
The 'Bikes Reunited' event will be held at Stafford Police Station from 10am until 2pm on Sunday August 26 - with people who have been victims of bike theft invited to come along and look at the recovered items.
In order to claim one of the stolen bikes, the owners must bring with them: A crime reference number or incident number issued by Staffordshire Police related to the theft Proof of ownership (i.e a form of receipt or proof of purchase A photograph of the bike in question
They should also have a good description of the bicycle with any distinguishing features which help identify it. Read More Appeal after van has windscreen smashed while parked on street
Access will be through the large blue gates on Tipping Street where the Policing Team will greet attendees.
A bicycle-frame marking event will also be taking place at Stafford Police Station on Saturday August 25 - with officers handing out 350 bike marking kits for members of the public who bring their bikes to the event.
The kits, which are funded using Proceeds of Crime Money and funded through the Police, Fire and Crime Commissioner's Office, will be given out on a first-come, first-service basis and anyone wanting one will have to have proof of address showing they live in the Stafford area.
The bike marking scheme also requires users to register their details on a website and keep them up to date with their contact details.
The rear gates on Tipping Street will open from 10am on Saturday 25 August and close at 3pm or earlier if the kits are all used. Crime prevention advice regarding bikes will also be available on the day. Read More Heatwave leads to discovery of historic sites in Staffordshire
Police said the event will be held in the rear yard of the police station, and the public should attend via the large blue gates at the side of the station, in Tipping Street (next to Stafford Magistrate's Court building) where they will be greeted and provided with a number and a time to return if necessary.
Chief Inspector Gemma Ward, Commander for Stafford Neighbourhood Policing Team, said: "We're pleased to announce details of these events which have been organised to help prevent bike theft in Stafford Borough, where we have recognised there is a problem and are responding proactively.
"There are simple crime prevention measures that bike owners can take to prevent theft, and we are keen to provide them with the right advice across the weekend. Read More Hospital chief announces retirement - and now plans to work with charities
"We'd also like to reunite many recently recovered bikes with their rightful owners. These have been seized following many arrests, searches of addresses and stop searches of suspects and this activity will continue, supported by information that we are receiving from the public on a daily basis.
"We are grateful for the continued public support with this problem which has significantly impacted on the local community."
She added members of the public attending are asked to find their own parking as there is none available at Stafford Police Station, and are also reminded that cycling through Stafford town centre is not permitted. Like us on Faceboo
