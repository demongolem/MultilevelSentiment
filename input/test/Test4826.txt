RACE 1
A big day of racing kicks off with the Highway Plate over 1600m.
Panzerfaust (14) looks the horse on the up and the hardest to beat here. He has looked very good in all career runs to date and steps up to the mile, which should suit. The form from his last start has stacked up with the winner running well since and happy to be with him.
Evopex (2) has won his last two and commands respect. He beat two in-form horses last time out and it's hard to knock winning form.
Cisco Bay (1) meets Evopex 4kg better for a half-length defeat two back and that ties him in. Forgive his last run with excuses and he must come into calculations.
The leader in the race looks to be Wallander (6) and he likes to dictate from the front. He has led all the way in two of his last three, including a Highway back on July 28 at Rosehill. He can give a great account of himself.

RACE 2
Just Shine (3) and Raqeeq (8) met two starts back with Just Shine 4kg better off here for that 1.3 length defeat. That may be enough to turn the tables from a perfect gate. The way he's been finishing off suggests the 2400m shouldn't be an issue.
Red Alto (2) has a good record over this distance and Angland sticks with him from his famous last start victory against a field of Waller runners. Screamarr (9) is racing in good heart. The 2400m is a new challenge but the way he's been finishing off his races suggests it is within his grasp.

RACE 3
Benchmark 78 and the speed looks good.
Almanzora (8) was luckless last start and can improve sharply second up. She got sent out favourite fresh but couldn't get warm in what was a complete forgive. Her trial suggested she's going well and can win this.
Rebel Miss (4) is hard to catch and needs things to go her way as she only has a short sprint on her. If things pan out for her though, she does possess the quality to run well. The tempo should suit.
Lightz (9) has always shown ability but has been disappointing on the race track. He went forward last start and won in good style. He can improve off that and give a good sight.
Gwenneth (7) will keep him company up on speed. Brook Magic (3) should get a nice run in transit from gate three and run well.

RACE 4
Great race for the 3YO fillies. Speed from Ready To Prophet and while she doesn't possess the ability or race record of some of her rivals she may give them something to catch.
Could make a strong case to say Oohood (3) was the best 2YO in the country last season, despite (quite amazingly) still being a maiden. She placed in a Group 1 Blue Diamond, Golden Slipper and Sires' Produce. Liked her Flemington jump-out, travelling nicely although not being asked to do too much. She's a deserved favourite and tipping her on top here but she will get back - want to see how the track is playing before diving in at $2.20.
Keep a close eye on Futooh (6) on the back of some impressive trials. She may need further but she's in for a good campaign. Look for her to be running on strongly.
Outback Barbie (4) and Fiesta (1) also trialled well leading in and both possess plenty of talent. Outback Barbie (4) may be able to settle a bit closer than her rivals, which looks a benefit. Can't fault.
Verdict: Oohood on top from Futooh but assess track pattern. The field for Randwick race 5. Source: Supplied
RACE 5
Group Three 1300m event for the 3YOs.
Like the recent trial of Encryption (1) and he may be sharper than some of his rivals over this distance fresh. He won the Black Opal in nice style and wasn't far away in a Group One Sires' Produce.
He finished alongside Spin (3) who broke his maiden in fine style first-up. That will do him the world of good and he can go on with it.
Irukandji (2) may be looking for further but hit the line impressively in a recent trial. He has ability and can't be dismissed.
Danawi (9) and Military Zone (8) met at Randwick on August 4 with the latter proving too strong. Both have chances.

RACE 6
The feature race of the day. In terms of how the race will play out, the speed looks good with Religify and Cabeza De Vaca likely to set the tempo. Ace High and Classic Uniform are looking for further but can be handy enough fresh. There should be enough pressure here. Kementari can be closer up to 1400m.
In a race named in her own honour, Winx (10) sets out to break Black Caviar's record of 25 straight wins here. These 1400m events early in her campaign on firmer surfaces are where she is vulnerable but she has overcome plenty before and it would take a brave person to tip against her. Loved her two trials, running through the line brilliantly on both occasions. If you needed any more convincing, Hugh Bowman got off her in her most recent and said it was probably the best she's gone in a trial.
The most interesting runner here is Kementari (7) who's had a boom on him for some time. He was a late entry for this with the stablemate Alizee ruled out for the Spring. He has the fitness edge with the one run under his belt and up to 1400m he can possie up closer than he did last start. He's all quality and looks set to run well.
D'argento (9) worked home well in the same trial as Winx and looks to be in really good order. He's already a Group One winner and his career record is superb having won 4 of 7. While I fully expect that to change here against the worlds best, it's worth noting he's yet to be beaten first-up.
Ace High (8) is all quality and probably still underrated. Liked his trial leading in and he can figure in the first four.
Verdict: Watch and enjoy the wonder mare. The field for Randwick race 7. Source: Supplied
RACE 7
Expecting Siege Of Quebec (7) to lead and be very hard to get past with a light weight. Don't mind the wide barrier for him as Tim Clark can take his time to cross. His two trials have been pleasing, winning both over the short course. He covered plenty of ground in his latest trial but responded to riding to beat a good field.
Dal Cielo (4) wasn't far away behind Trekking last week and is well off at the weights on the minimum. He carried 61kg last start and won't know himself here.
Le Romain (1) is the class galloper and is a deserved top weight. He will find this easier than the Group Ones he contested last campaign and has been trialling pleasingly. He hasn't won for some time which is the concern, along with the big weight.
Verdict: Siege of Quebec WIN The field for Randwick race 8. Source: Supplied
RACE 8
The Group One Toy Show Quality for the Fillies and Mares over 1300m. Very little speed engaged which is not only a surprise, but it makes it tricky to map.
Completely putting a pen through the first-up run of Egyptian Symbol (1). Her trials prior to that were superb and she can bounce back in a big way. She's too good to ignore and her best would be winning this.
Insensata (8) is flying and looks set to peak third up over 1300m. Her run third-up last campaign in the Group Two Millie Fox suggests she's right up to this and she get's a lovely run from barrier 2. Well off on the minimum weight.
I Am Coldplay (2) has been trialling pleasingly but she did get back in them which raises a query as to where she'll get to here. 1300m looks ideal first-up and Bowman takes the ride, which is a positive. She is Group 2 placed in New Zealand and can run well here before improving into her campaign.
Luvaluva (5) is all class and she too has gone well in both trials. She might find a couple of these a bit sharp but look for her to be running on. She's got bigger fish to fry in the Spring.
Verdict: Egyptian Symbol (BEST VALUE) The field for Randwick race 9. Source: Supplied
RACE 9
Looking to finish the day on a high with a nice each-way play in the form of Best Of Days (1). The former international has been running over 2000m+ in recent times but his two career wins were over 1400m and the mile. First-up at 1400m on the back of two nice trials, he looks well suited and happy to be with him.
Kaonic (5) had plenty of favours last time but has always been a horse with a lot of ability. He can go on with it.
Souchez (3) was fantastic fresh, running smart late sectionals in closing off well for 6th. He's a two time winner second up and looks well suited at the 1400m from a good gate.
Onslaught (8) in for fourth.
Verdict: Best of Days Each Wa
