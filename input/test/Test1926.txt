A market research report was recently published in Market Gazette , detailing key companies leading the Bird Dispersal Systems industry. The report explores competitor analysis, product and service analysis, end user studies, and analysis based on regions. The report covers all military and civil applications. Another aspect of the report is sonic devices, like Bird-X's Super BirdXPellerÂ® PRO that emits recorded calls to scare and alarm many different pest birds without traps or chemicals. The sounds come at random intervals, so that the targeted birds do not grow acclimated to any set pattern of sounds. These sounds tell the birds that the area they are in is unsafe, and to seek more welcoming grounds. This is a safe, humane way to keep birds out of a number of areas like large commercial spaces, military bases, and agricultural settings.
Laser devices are also discussed. Laser bird control is a well-documented way to chase away pest birds. Laser beams are perfect for scaring pest birds away without sound. Instead, colored laser beams that are detectable by the pests, force them away from the targeted property for good.
