For example, alcohol may inhibit the effects of leptin -- a hormone that suppresses appetite -- and glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1), a hormone that inhibits food intake, she explained.<br />There might be other mechanisms at play, too. Some research suggests that alcohol might stimulate nerve cells in the brain's hypothalamus that increase appetite. According to one study, neurons in the brain that are generally activated by actual starvation, causing an intense feeling of hunger,<br />can be stimulated by alcohol<br />.<br />"Animal research shows that, independent of other factors, when alcohol stimulates this part of the brain, it can trigger a sharp increase in appetite, which can lead to overeating," Hultin said. "Instead of the body recognizing 'I just got a lot of calories, so I have fuel and I'm full,' the opposite occurs. Though calories have been ingested, the brain is triggering more food intake."<br />The non-alcoholic&#39;s guide to drinking less alcohol<br />Alcohol can also lower blood sugar, which can cause us to crave sugar and carbs. "Drinking alcohol can impair the liver's ability to release the right amount of glycogen, or stored glucose, into the blood to keep blood glucose levels stable," Hultin said. People with diabetes are at even higher risk for low blood sugar levels when they drink, according to Hultin, particularly when consuming alcohol on an empty stomach.<br />But another challenge with alcohol -- which is different from<br />drugs like pot<br />-- is that alcohol itself is high in calories, with 7 per gram. That's more calories than you get per gram of protein or carbs, which have 4 calories per gram each.<br />A 5-ounce glass of wine might have only 120 or 125 calories, and a light beer even less, but mixers, juice, soda, syrups, cream and coconut all pack sugar and fat calories on top of alcohol, Hultin explained. "Margaritas and pina coladas are classically very high in calories, with some estimates pushing up towards 500 calories for one drink, depending on the size and how it's made."<br />Tips to curb alcohol munchies<br />Before you take your next sips of wine, beer or spirits, learn some helpful tips to curb alcohol munchies.<br />Drink with a balanced meal.<br />"Include whole-grain, complex carbohydrates, healthy fat and protein so that your body is nourished and satiated from the start," Hultin said. This will also ensure that your "munchies" aren't actual hunger, reflecting the body's need for a meal.<br />Get CNN Health&#39;s weekly newsletter<br /
