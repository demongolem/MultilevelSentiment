Running for a Cause: Julia and Michael Faucher race in memory of friend for ALS One team at Falmouth Road Race 29 29 PM By Josh SchaferContributing writer
Family and friends of the Fauchers don't throw out their bottles and cans.
Instead they bag them and get them to the Faucher family. Michael, 11, and his mother, Julia, have collected more than 100,000 bottles and cans in the last two years. And they come from everywhere.
Michael placed a bin in the lobby of Kittredge Elementary in North Andover for his classmates to donate. Colleagues of Julia, an employee of North Andover Middle School, filled her classroom with bags of cans and bottles while she was at meetings. Numerous members of the community drop off items at Julia's parents home in Duxbury. They all know about Michael and many call him "Michael Recycle."
It's added up to roughly $5,000 just from recycled items, all of which is donated to ALS One, a foundation started by Julia's college friend, Kevin Gosnell.
"If anyone in our house even considers throwing a can away â€¦ we're like, 'Oh, my God, what are you doing?'" Julia said. "We'll never look at a bottle and can the same way."
Julia will run in the New Balance Falmouth Road Race on Sunday for the third time as a member of the ALS One team. The team honors her former Framingham State classmate, Gosnell, and his mission to find a cure for the disease that cost him his life in 2016.
Michael will join Julia in the race. The Fauchers have raised roughly $45,000 for ALS One in the last three years, more than $16,000 of which was raised this year alone.
"We have to keep going on Kevin's work efforts," Michael said. "Kevin started it. Now we're going to finish it."
After being diagnosed with Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) in spring 2015, Gosnell researched his newly diagnosed disease and discovered that no one had researched the disease through partnerships. This limited communication between different medical practices, making a cure harder to find.
ALS One was founded in January 2016, combining leaders in ALS research from Massachusetts General Hospital, UMass Medical School and Harvard Medical School, among others. The non-profit focuses 90 percent of its funds toward finding a cure while the other 10 percent helps current victims of the disease with their everyday life in combination with Compassionate Care ALS in Falmouth.
In three years of participating in the Falmouth Road Race, with around 120 runners on its team, ALS One has raised more than $725,000. Jen DiMartino, ALS One Executive Director, said the race is the biggest fundraiser of the year for the non-profit, which has raised $9 million for ALS research.
"We're really lucky," DiMartino said. "The Falmouth Road Race, they do such an amazing job of incorporating non-profits into it and allowing them to have that platform."
Kevin was a part of the initial push for ALS One leading into its first year in the race.
At a meet-and-greet event in 2016, Gosnell expressed his gratitude for those helping and urged them to continue the fight. He died a week later on Aug. 8, 2016.
"Since then I've wanted to continue his mission," Julia Faucher said. "And I promised him that I would continue to help fight the fight after he was gone."
And that's what the Fauchers have done, aiding research in any way possible.
On June 30, Michael Faucher and his family set up two large tables and canopies underneath a tree in front of his grandparents house in Duxbury. Below them were two coolers, one for ice and one for lemonade, that had been donated by the Big Y. On top of the tables was an assortment of bags for the 15 raffles which accompanied Michael's favorite fundraiser, the lemonade stand.
Michael doesn't sell lemonade like an average middle schooler. In each of the last two years, more than $1,000 has gone to ALS One just from the one event.
"What they do is they just make everybody feel so good about getting involved and donating," DiMartino said. "The way that they thank people and it makes people just want to get involved."
Each donation to the Faucher team is accompanied by a Facebook post from Julia thanking the donor for the support and providing an update on where the team is at.
On Aug. 12, one week from race day, Michael took to Facebook with a video message for their supporters.
"Michael Recycle here," he announced proudly. "I've come to tell you it's only seven days away from Falmouth. We're still accepting cans and donations. We're on to 16,000 dollars going on to 17. Michael Recycle signing out."
He then cracked open a can of Barq's root beer and took a big gulp.
"Five cents," he said with a smile before sipping once more. "For ALS." Never miss a stor
