Abstract:<br />(EN)<br />Method for cool drying gas by guiding gas through the secondary section (9) of a heat exchanger (2) whose primary section forms the evaporator (3) of a closed cooling circuit (4) in which a coolant can circulate by means of a compressor (5) that is followed by a condenser (6) and expansion means (7) through which the coolant can circulate, whereby use is made of an air-cooled condenser (6) with a frequency controlled fan (19), and the method comprises the step of controlling the speed of the aforementioned fan (19) so that the condenser pressure (p<br />c<br />) is kept equal to a target value.<br /></form><br /
