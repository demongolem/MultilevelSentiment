Press release from: Market Research Future Obstructive lung disease is a category of respiratory disease characterized by airway obstruction. Many obstructive diseases of the lung manifest due to the narrowing of bronchi which often cause excessive contraction of smooth muscles. The major types of obstructive lung disease include asthma, bronchiectasis, bronchitis and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Increase in prevalence of COPD and asthma patients, rising geriatric population, increase in pipeline products, growing government and non-government initiatives for spreading awareness are the major factors driving the growth of the global obstructive lung diseases market.As per the Global Burden of Disease study, it is estimated that chronic obstructive pulmonary disease caused 3.2 million deaths globally in 2015. Disease burden due to COPD was the highest in India, Nepal, Papua New Guinea, and Lesotho. COPD manifests itself as an occupational hazard in people working in agriculture, mining, plastics, and other industries.Governments across each country have implemented regulations for the production, standardization, and utilization of COPD devices. These devices are divided into categories â€“Class-I, Class-II, Class-III, and Class-IV, depending upon the level of risk associated. However, stringent government regulatory requirement for the approval of asthma and COPD drugs, side effects associated with the drug treatment, and patent expiry of drugs restrict the market growth.Get Sample Copy of Report At: www.marketresearchfuture.com/sample_request/5367/ Obstructive Lung Disease Market Key Companies Analyzed In Report AreGlaxoSmithKline (GSK) (U.K), Novartis AG (Switzerland), Merck & Co.

The Americas is projected to hold the largest share of the global obstructive lung disease market due to presence of superior research and development base, strong regional economics, and greater emphasis on disease prevention and wellness by governments.The European obstructive lung disease market is expected to witness rapid growth owing to the high investment in various private and government funded research and development programs in the region and increased spending on pharmaceutical and biotechnology industry development. Countries such as China, Japan, and India in Asia Pacific are also poised to be promising markets for obstructive lung disease in the near future. The healthcare expenditure in Asia increased due to an extension of state healthcare programs and the increasing affluence of the population. India is anticipated to witness an expansion in spending due to a government resolution to enhance healthcare services. Moreover, China and South Korea are thriving to develop their biotechnology sector for diagnosis purpose. China's efforts to develop its biotech sector has shown good results in sectors such as vaccines and biological products and the same can be expected in the obstructive lung disease industry. However, low research and development (R&D) yields, high infrastructure cost, stringent regulatory framework are some of the restraints of the obstructive lung disease market.The Middle East region is expected to grow at a faster rate due to the factors such as the extensive development of healthcare infrastructure and growing emphasis on research and development in the healthcare sector.Major TOC:Table 1 Obstructive Lung Disease Industry Synopsis, 2017 â€“ 2023 Table 2 Obstructive Lung Disease Market Estimates And Forecast, 2017 â€“ 2023, (USD Million) Table 3 Obstructive Lung Disease Market By Region, 2017 â€“ 2023, (USD Million) Table 4 Obstructive Lung Disease Market By Disease Type, 2017 â€“ 2023, (USD Million) Table 5 Obstructive Lung Disease Market By Product Type, 2017 â€“ 2023, (USD Million) Table 6 Obstructive Lung Disease Market By Drug Class, 2017 â€“ 2023, (USD Million) Table 7 Obstructive Lung Disease Market By Route Of Administration, 2017 â€“ 2023, (USD Million) Table 8 Obstructive Lung Disease Market By End Users, 2017 â€“ 2023, (USD Million) Table 9 North America Obstructive Lung Disease Market By Disease Type, 2017 â€“ 2023, (USD Million) Table 10 North America Obstructive Lung Disease Market By Product Type, 2017 â€“ 2023, (USD Million) Table 11 North America Obstructive Lung Disease Market By Drug Class, 2017 â€“ 2023, (USD Million) Table 12 North America Obstructive Lung Disease Market By Route Of Administration, 2017 â€“ 2023, (USD Million) Table 13 North America Obstructive Lung Disease Market By End User, 2017 â€“ 2023, (USD Million) Table 14 US Obstructive Lung Disease Market By Disease Type, 2017 â€“ 2023, (USD Million) Table 15 US Obstructive Lung Disease Market By Product Type, 2017 â€“ 2023, (USD Million)List of Figures: Figure 2 Segmentation For Obstructive Lung Disease Market Figure 3 Segmentation Market Dynamics For Obstructive Lung Disease Market Figure 4 Global Obstructive Lung Disease Market Share, By Disease Type 2016 Figure 5 Global Obstructive Lung Disease Market Share, By Product Type 2016 Figure 6 Global Obstructive Lung Disease Market Share, By Drug Class, 2016 Figure 8 Global Obstructive Lung Disease Market Share, By Route Of Administration, 2016 Figure 9 Global Obstructive Lung Disease Market Share, By End Users, 2016 Figure 10 Global Obstructive Lung Disease Market Share, By Region, 2016 Figure 11 North America Obstructive Lung Disease Market Share, By Country, 2016 Figure 12 Europe Obstructive Lung Disease Market Share, By Country, 2016 Figure 13 Asia Pacific Obstructive Lung Disease Market Share, By Country, 2016 Figure 14 The Middle East & Africa Obstructive Lung Disease Market Share, By Country, 2016 Figure 15 Global Obstructive Lung Disease Market: Company Share Analysis, 2016 (%) Browse more on "Obstructive Lung Disease Research Report- Forecast 2023" at: www.marketresearchfuture.com/enquiry/5367/ About US: Market Research Future (MRFR), enable customers to unravel the complexity of various industries through Cooked Research Report (CRR), Half-Cooked Research Reports (HCRR), Raw Research Reports (3R), Continuous-Feed Research (CFR), and Market Research & Consulting Services.Contact Us: Office No. 528, Amanora Chambers Magarpatta Road, Hadapsar
