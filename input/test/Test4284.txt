The FDA recently issued a notice to warn doctors and patients of the risks associated with off-label uses of devices normally used to destroy abnormal or pre-cancerous cervical or vaginal tissue and genital warts.
The FDA issued its notice July 30, 2018, alerting doctors and patients the agency has concerns about use of energized medical devices being used for vaginal rejuvenation treatment .
The term vaginal rejuvenation is not well-defined, but generally it refers to non-surgical procedures designed to treat a variety of vaginal changes, including dryness, itching, lack of elasticity, atrophy, or painful sex or painful urination. The FDA says it has not cleared any device for the purpose of vaginal rejuvenation treatment.
Advertising efforts target women who have survived cancer and suffered negative gynecological effects from hormone imbalances. Most marketing is directed at post-menopausal women who contend with dryness, laxity, painful sex or painful urination.
Vaginal Rejuvenation Treatment Problems Some device manufacturers and some gynecologists are marketing energy-based devices as ways to treat undesired vaginal changes related to menopause, urinary incontinence or sexual problems, says the FDA's warning.
"The safety and effectiveness of energy-based devices for treatment of these conditions has not been established," the warning says.
The FDA has sent letters to several companies to ask them to stop marketing vaginal rejuvenation treatment as a service available to patients using the medical devices normally used to treat pre-cancerous cells and genital warts.
Among the companies who received a letter regarding their alleged marketing of off-label vaginal rejuvenation treatment are:
Venus Concept BTL Industries Cynosure Alma Lasers Sciton Thermigen Inmode MD The letters urge these companies to discontinue deceptive advertising about the devices. Off-label vaginal rejuvenation treatment by energy-based devices has led to burning, scarring and painful sex after treatments.
Many companies, such as Cynosure, market the lasers as in-office treatments with "minimal side effects" and "no down time." Cynosure promotes MonaLisa Touch as a probe that "delivers gentle laser energy to the vaginal wall, stimulating a healing response. The total procedure takes less than five minutes."
Cynosure recommends three five-minute treatments at 6-week intervals for "post-menopausal women with gynelogic health concerns."
Cynosure's website, smilemonalisa.com, almost makes MonaLisa Touch vaginal rejuvenation treatment sound like a fountain of youth, touting the device as "innovative technology for vaginal and vulvar health."
Some of the providers who offer vaginal rejuvenation treatment are not licensed physicians. Aestheticians and nurses have started businesses that promote vaginal rejuvenation treatment among their "specialties."
Lasers that are turned too high or concentrate on delicate tissue for too long can cause permanent scarring, burning or nerve damage.
A number of celebrities have touted vaginal rejuvenation treatment as a way to recapture their gynecological youth, but off-label uses of medical equipment that has not been tested and proven safe and effective for the delicate vaginal tissue could prove irreversibly damaging.
