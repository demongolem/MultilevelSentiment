More than a week after the police laid a trap at the airport the accused was nabbed on Wednesday. One of the victims of the accused includes a Std X student, who was duped of Rs 800, a debit card and a mobile phone last week. On August 8, an unknown man claiming to be a resident of Delhi approached a 15-year-old Yash Jadhav near Dadar railway station. The unknown man asked for Jadhav's mobile phone on the pretext of making a call to his parents, who were coming to pick him up after his luggage and wallet went missing at the railway station. After a few calls, the man identified himself as Rajiv and asked Jadhav to help him with the directions towards the international airport. After the teenager helped Rajiv, the latter began pleading him to accompany till the airport as he knew nothing about the city. Soon the duo booked a cab and went to the airport. Since Rajiv did not have a wallet on him, Jadhav paid the fare and gave Rs 300 to the man, which he promised to return. Upon reaching the arrival section, they waited for 45 minutes, but Rajiv's parents did not come. Suspecting they must be lost, Rajiv once again asked for Jadhav's phone and went to make a call. Fifteen minutes later Rajiv never returned, and Jadhav realised he was duped of his phone and a debit card. Jadhav immediately approached Sahar police for help and registered a complaint against Rajiv. Acting on his complaint, the sleuths deployed four men at the airport's arrival area and three men at the departure area. The police had also procured the CCTV footage of the arrival area where Jadhav was allegedly cheated and caught the accused's picture in the frame. After a week of keeping an eye, the accused turned up at the airport on Wednesday and was arrested by Sahar police. The investigation revealed his name was Mangesh Ispik, and he used the modus operandi of approaching people and narrating his sob story, only to rob and dupe people. Till now he has confessed of cheating 23 persons. The police also seized eight credit and debit cards from Ispik, along with two identity cards, both with fake names. The Sahar police have booked him under relevant sections of the Indian Penal Code for cheating (section 420) and remanded him to police custody till Saturday. Share this Post
