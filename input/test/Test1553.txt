Zach Schonbrun<br />Aug. 23, 2018<br />PARAMUS, N.J. â€” It was still early in his round on Thursday, but Tiger Woods was already letting frustration show. He flung his club at his bag and held his hands on his hips while watching his ball trickle slowly, slowly, off the front edge of the dinner-table-narrow 12th green.<br />He needed 102 yards with his wedge but got only about 95 â€” the result, he would say later, of soft conditions at Ridgewood Country Club that left him with a choice of being dangerously aggressive or reluctantly defensive on several holes. It was an uncomfortable decision that seemed to hamstring his accuracy.<br />On average this season, when Woods takes a shot from 100 yards, he brings it within 14 feet of the pin. On No. 12 at Ridgewood, he was left with 53.<br />â€œOne of those days,â€� Woods said, repeating the phrase several times after his latest mediocre first round in a season full of them. After shooting an par 71 to start the Northern Trust tournament on Thursday, he was five shots behind the leaders, Kevin Tway, Sean Oâ€™Hair, Jamie Lovemark and Vaughn Taylor. In an unusual setup, each golfer started at the ninth hole and finished on No. 8.<br />Woods arrived here for the first part of the four-leg FedEx Cup playoffs after a second-place finish at the P.G.A. Championship two weeks ago, feeling confident about his game and closer to the form that had propelled him to 14 major titles and celebrity far beyond his sport.<br />But his comeback this year from multiple back operations has yielded inconsistent results, and Woods is still searching for his first PGA Tour victory since 2013. On Thursday, he seemed to be struggling with his distance control and precision off the tee and with his wedges, hitting 9 of 14 fairways and 11 of 18 greens in regulation.<br />Woods said he did not feel comfortable with pin placements and conditions, making club selection a challenge.<br />â€œI just didnâ€™t have situations where I had the full club and I could go ahead and take a rip at it and go after the flags,â€� Woods said. â€œI kept having to play a little defensive.â€�<br />By comparison, Woods said, the layouts at the P.G.A. Championship and the British Open (where he finished tied for sixth) had allowed him to attack holes.<br />â€œThose are days where you take full advantage,â€� Woods said. â€œAnd then there are days when you donâ€™t.â€�<br />Image<br />Kevin Tway shot a five-under-par 66 to share the first-day lead with Sean Oâ€™Hair, Jamie Lovemark and Vaughn Taylor.<br />Credit<br />Gregory Shamus/Getty Images<br />Early in his comeback, Woods was a lot less likely to show exasperation after an errant shot. The flung club on 12 here suggested that his expectations had grown considerably as he had become more of a contender again.<br />Thursdayâ€™s round was the ninth time in 15 events this season that he had shot par on Day 1 of a tournament. Those slow starts have meant a lot of weekend scrambling, which has produced several dramatic late charges up the leaderboard. Entering this tournament, Woods led the tour with a 68.42 scoring average in the third round this season. He ranked 133rd in first rounds with an average of 71.07.<br />Woods said his slow starts early this year had reflected the fact that he was easing his way back into competitive golf, needing time to find his rhythm. Now he does not see that as a problem.<br />â€œPretty much since the Open Championship, Iâ€™ve felt pretty good about my starts,â€� Woods said. â€œRight now, I think thereâ€™s 40 or 41 guys at one under par through five under par. Just a very bunched board right now, and I think thatâ€™s going to be that by the end of the week.â€�<br />The crowds were out early to watch Woods, who teed off at 7:54 a.m. in a group with Tommy Fleetwood, who shot a 67, and Marc Leishman, who carded a 73. Woodsâ€™s round included two birdies and two bogeys.<br />If there was any doubt about the return of his commercial cachet, it was eliminated after Wednesdayâ€™s formal announcement of a $9 million match-play event against Phil Mickelson in Las Vegas on Nov. 23. The showdown will be on pay-per-view.<br />Other golfers could only chuckle at the prospect of the event attracting paid television viewers.<br />â€œIâ€™ve never played one,â€� Brooks Koepka, the winner of this yearâ€™s P.G.A. Championship and United States Open, said about a $9 million match. â€œBut Iâ€™d be happy to if anybody wants to play.â€�<br />Mickelson, 48, who joined Twitter on Wednesday in time for the announcement,<br />posted a message<br />directed at the 42-year-old Woods: â€œI bet you think this is the easiest $9M you will ever make.â€� But on Thursday at Ridgewood, Mickelson came out ahead of Woods, posting a 68.<br />In the group right behind Woods, Koepka and Dustin Johnson also shot 67. It was an uneven round for Johnson, who made a triple-bogey eight on the par-5 17th hole. Then he nearly aced the par-3 sixth with a shot that hit the lip and bounced out.<br />The noise from the crowd should have given him an indication of how close he was. But Johnson, the worldâ€™s No. 1 player, said he still was not sure if cheers had actually come from people following Woods.<br />â€œI was kind of debating whether they were yelling for me or him,â€� he said.<br />But in his opening round, Woods never had the kind of moment that would produce such a roar.<br />A version of this article appears in print on<br />, on Page<br /
