Imagination will take you everywhere." I think this sums up the biggest challenge that we have today with innovation in India. Children are extremely imaginative, but as they grow, imagination dies as people struggle to conform. Growing up, my father always encouraged me to ask questions and challenge status quo. I believe that a healthy dialogue is crucial to build a culture of innovation. If we look at world history, the path breaking innovations we see today have been the direct result of people going against the tide and daring to ask questions. There are five barriers to innovation, perceptual, emotional, cultural, intellectual and environmental. There's a saying in Kannada, which when loosely translated means a poet's eyes can see what even the Sun cannot see; a drunkard can see what even the poet cannot see. Any situation doesn't just depend on the external factors but also on your own mental beliefs. â€¦ February 11, 2018 Low-code tools are making it easier for citizen developers to create custom business apps that improve productivity and agility. But do they put an organization at risk? Business users have traditionally relied on IT personnel who can write code or manage complex administration tools to build, configure, and modify applications for their specific needs. However, faced with an increasing number of projects and the shrinking number of available developers, IT departments are forced to establish a cut line. As a result, many valid project requests from business units never see the prioritization light of day. Some companies have responded by teaching their non-technical personnel to code. This do-it-yourself development theme is being catered to by a slew of software vendors under the moniker of "citizen developer"â€” employees without formal programming training or experience who create apps outside of IT. With minimal coding skills, the thinking goes, non-technical knowledge workers caâ€¦ February 16, 2018 ( Reuters ) â€” One of Walmart's best chances at taking on Amazon.com in ecommerce lies with six giant server farms, each larger than ten football fields. These facilities, which cost Walmart millions of dollars and took nearly five years to build, are starting to pay off. The retailer's online sales have been on a tear for the last three consecutive quarters, far outpacing wider industry growth levels. Powering that rise are thousands of proprietary servers that enable the company to crunch almost limitless swathes of customer data in-house. Most retailers rent the computing capacity they need to store and manage such information. But Walmart's decision to build its own internal cloud network shows its determination to grab a bigger slice of online shopping, in part by imitating Amazon's use of cloud-powered big data to drive digital sales. The effort is helping Walmart to stay competitive with Amazon on pricing and to tightly control key functions such as inventory. And it is allowing â€¦ March 12, 2018 Battlerite is a Multiplayer Online Battle Arena game (MOBA) you might not expect us to cover here on UploadVR, but it's actually making headlines for the second time. Last week the game's developer Stunlock Studios launched its new CamCrew spectator mode . It allows viewers to watch matches unfold in real-time. More importantly, though, the option allows you to put on an Oculus Rift or HTC Vive and watch live matches or replays come to life inside your headset, much like the DOTA 2 VR spectator mode Valve added to its hit MOBA a few years ago. Better yet, a built-in video renderer allows you to create your own clips from battles with your control over the camera putting you in the director's chair. "CamCrew is really a whole new way of working with cinematography in digital media," Stunlock's Head of VR Tobias Johansson said in a prepared statement. "It empowers single users to create content almost in real time that could rival any big production studio with animators and expensive eâ€¦ March 18, 2018 DOES the possibility of C-3PO standing by the side of your hospital bed, his gold metal fingers operating on your heart, fill you with dread or with hope? What about the idea of sitting down on the psychologist's couch with Data to talk through your feelings, or getting Wall-E to help look after your elderly parents in a nursing home? It may sound far-fetched, but there are those within the medical profession who say the role of doctor or surgeon could one day be close to redundant, overtaken by forms of artificial intelligence (AI) that can diagnose and treat illness and injury better than any human medical professional could. This new reality could be just a decade or two away. In fact, in many areas of the healthcare system, the rise (and rise) of AI has already begun. STATE OF PLAY AS A world-renowned AI scientist, University of New South Wales professor Toby Walsh has likely had to say, "Don't panic!" on a regular basis recently.
