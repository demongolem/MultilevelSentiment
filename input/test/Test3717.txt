PHOTO: LIMBA MUPETAMI The Africa Gold Cup final between Namibia and Kenya, which doubles as a Japan 2019 Rugby World Cup qualification match, promises to be a mouth-watering affair.Namibia is unbeaten so far in the cup competition and the team is hoping to qualify directly for Japan at the Hage Geingob Stadium in Windhoek tomorrow, instead of having to battle it out in a repechage tournament in France.Head coach Phil Davies said his team is looking forward to a big challenge against Kenya."The mood in the Namibian camp is excellent. We have great respect for Kenya and we are all very much looking forward to a big challenge on Saturday," he said.Asked about the speed the Kenyan team possess, Davies said quick players are always a threat in any team."We have good speed in our team as well, and it's not about watching specific players; it's all about Namibia playing as a strong collective unit and matching a very talented Kenyan side."According to Davies, Namibia will not make many changes from its previous team that beat Zimbabwe, adding their match fitness is very good.The Welshman added the weather conditions on Saturday will be perfect for both teams."The pitch will be nice and dry and will favour running rugby. It will be a fantastic occasion, one that African rugby will be proud of, I'm sure."Davies said the players have prepared well and are looking forward to the challenge.He appealed for a big crowd on Saturday to back the team.Kenya coach Ian Snook said past performances in Namibia will not dampen their team spirit.He said Kenya would love to claim automatic qualification, but the team will have a second chance during the repechage competition in Marseille in November, if they lose tomorrow.This competition will also feature Germany, Hong Kong and Canada, with the winner sealing the final spot at next year's World Cup."Our hopes and aspirations are that we play really well and piece together 80 minutes of what has only been seen for 40 or so minutes in the other games. It has been difficult with no warm-up games and going in cold for one-off test matches," Snook said.Rugby fan Steven Paul said he will swamp the stadium with a group friends to support the home side."This is a big match for us. I will don my Namibian rugby T-shirt and support the team, as I have always done. I urge every loyal ruby supporter to do the same. Let's show the world that we are behind our team all the way," Paul said.Other Africa Gold Cup matches tomorrow see Uganda take on Zimbabwe and Tunisia face Morocco.
