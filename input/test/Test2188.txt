As Sonali Bendre fights cancer, we're moved by her 13-year-old son's strength and attitude The teenager has been so mature By ELLE team
Ever since Sonali Bendre went public forth with her cancer diagnosis in July, the film industry has rallied around her. The unexpected diagnosis of high-grade cancer came as a shock to everyone. The actor has been frank about her health, not just with her fans on social media, but also with her 13-year-old son, Ranveer.
Reacting to the news maturely, Ranveer has been a rock of support for his mom and a source of strength and positivity. In a new Instagram post, he acknowledged the people who have supported him. He wrote: 'U all have created a ring of light all around me. Thanks to everyone for all the support you all have given me.' U all have created a ring of light all around me. . . . . Thanks too everyone for all the support you all have given me. A post shared by rockbehl (@rockbehl) on Aug 15, 2018 at 2:09am PDT
Sonali and her husband Goldie's decision to involve her son in her fight against cancer has definitely paid off. In an Instagram post, she had written about the importance of keeping children updated in such a situation. "As much as we wanted to protect him, we knew it was important to tell him the full facts. We've always been open and honest with him and this time it wasn't going to be different... In some situations now, he even reverses roles and takes on being the parent, reminding me of things I need to do!" she wrote. From the moment he was born 12 years, 11 months and 8 days ago, my amazing @rockbehl took ownership of my heart. From then on, his happiness and wellbeing have been the centre of anything @goldiebehl and I ever did. And so, when the Big C reared its ugly head, our biggest dilemma was what and how we were going to tell him. As much as we wanted to protect him, we knew it was important to tell him the full facts. We've always been open and honest with him and this time it wasn't going to be different. He took the news so maturelyâ€¦ and instantly became a source of strength and positivity for me. In some situations now, he even reverses roles and takes on being the parent, reminding me of things I need to do! I believe that it's imperative to keep kids involved in a situation like this. They are a lot more resilient than we give them credit for. It's important to spend time with them and include them, rather than make them wait on the side-lines, not being told yet instinctively knowing everything. In our effort to protect them from the pain and realities of life, we might end up doing the opposite. I'm spending time with Ranveer right now, while he's on summer vacation. His madness and shenanigans help me #SwitchOnTheSunshine. And today, we derive strength from each other #OneDayAtATime A post shared by Sonali Bendre (@iamsonalibendre) on Jul 18, 2018 at 11:29pm PDT
Sonali is currently undergoing treatment in the US. Last week, Ranveer turned 13 and it was the first time she was not with him on his birthday. She wished him on Instagram with a video collage of their photographs from over the years. She wrote: "Wow, you're a teenager now... Will need some time to wrap my head around that fact. I can't tell you enough how proud I am of you... Your wit, your humour, your strength, your kindness, and even your mischief. Happy happy birthday, my not-so-little one." Ranv r! My sun, my moon, my stars, my sky... Okay, maybe I'm being a bit melodramatic, but your 13th birthday deserves this. Wow, you're a teenager now... Will need some time to wrap my head around that fact. I can't tell you enough how proud I am of you... Your wit, your humour, your strength, your kindness, and even your mischief. Happy happy birthday, my not-so-little one. It's the first one that we're not together... I miss you terribly. Lots and lots of love always and forever.... b g hug! @rockbehl A post shared by Sonali Bendre (@iamsonalibendre) on Aug 10, 2018 at 9:29pm PDT
As Sonali began chemotherapy, she trimmed her hair short and has now shaved her head completely. On Friendship Day, she posted an image of her hanging out with her best friends, Gayatri Oberoi and Sussane Khan, and said she is looking for every opportunity to find joy. Using the hashtag #BaldIsBeautiful, she also remarked: "Nowadays I spend far less time getting ready because I don't have to fuss over my hair.
