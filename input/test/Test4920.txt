Exondys51 sales of $74M topped our expectations (see below) by 5%, and accelerated sequentially in 2Q18, after a slight dip in 1Q18. However, SRPT kept its FY18 guidance unchanged. OPEX is increasing faster than expectations, with FY18E non-GAAP OPEX potentially >2X 2016 levels of $198M. With sales growth starting to slow to high single digits Q/Q, focus is increasingly turning to the early/mid-stage pipeline to deliver commercial products in the near term. We continue to believe that gene therapy projects will take a minimum of 3-5 years to get to market and the exon- skipping agents (53 & 45) on-market by 2020. We stay neutral on the name."" 8/9/2018 â€“ Horizon Pharma had its "buy" rating reaffirmed by analysts at Piper Jaffray Companies.

Primary care brands beat expectations ($101.1M vs. $85.9M consensus), and Horizon is now reorganizing its segments to segregate this unit from the rest of the company. Krystexxa sales were $58.6M (+53% Y/Y) and also beat consensus expectations of $56.3M. The Teprotumumab trial is now fully enrolled, significantly ahead of schedule, and the company will present its one-year Teprotumumab data at the American Thyroid Association conference (Oct 3-7 in Washington, DC). We will update estimates after the 8 AM call."" 8/8/2018 â€“ Horizon Pharma was given a new $21.00 price target on by analysts at Cantor Fitzgerald.

According to Zacks, "Horizon Pharma's orphan and rheumatology business units witnessed strong growth. We expect Krystexxa, Ravicti and Actimmune to drive further growth. The acquisition of teprotumumab has further diversified the company's portfolio. However, revenues from primary care business units declined due to the implementation of a new commercial model where the company is contracting with pharmacy benefit managers and payers to help patients obtain access to its medicines. In June 2017, Horizon Pharma sold the marketing rights for Procysbi and Quinsair in Europe, the Middle East and Africa to Chiesi Farmaceutici S.p.A. to focus on higher return businesses. Shares of the company have outperformed the industry so far this year." 7/10/2018 â€“ Horizon Pharma was upgraded by analysts at Zacks Investment Research from a "hold" rating to a "buy" rating.
