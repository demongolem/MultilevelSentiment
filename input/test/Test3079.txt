UAE organisations that digitally transform on the cloud first will seize market share and business competitiveness, said Abboud. Published: 16 August 2018 - 1:04 p.m. By: David Ndichu SAP has announced the opening of its first cloud data centre in the UAE. As the UAE's public and private sectors heavily invest in their organisation-wide digital transformation, with a strong focus on adopting scalable cloud-based solutions, the UAE's IT market is set to grow by 20%, from USD 5.5 billion in 2018 to USD 6.6 billion by 2021, according to BMI Research. The launch marks a major milestone in the company's SAP's five-year USD 200 million investment plan for the UAE. "The UAE is already at the forefront of technology innovation, and the UAE organisations that digitally transform on the cloud first will seize market share and business competitiveness," said Gergi Abboud, senior vice president and general manager, SAP Middle East South. "Our cloud data centre will support UAE Vision 2021's goals to accelerate diversified economic growth and Smart Cities, support innovative start-ups and entrepreneurs, and fuel youth job creation in the fast-paced technology sector." The SAP Cloud Data Centre allows UAE organisations to subscribe to SAP's cloud solutions across 25 industries. The SAP Cloud Platform is now live to support SAP customers' digital transformation together with SAP Ariba procurement software, SAP C/4 HANA customer relationship suite, SAP HANA in-memory platform, SAP S/4HANA real-time suite, as well as the SAP SuccessFactors human resources management system. In the Middle East and North Africa, more than 60% of all companies, and about 75% of the digital leaders, are investing in the cloud through 2019, according to the recent SAP and Oxford Economics Digital Transformation Executive Study. "Over the past five years, the cloud has moved from an "if" question to a "when" question in the UAE," said Julien Bertin, Managing Director, SAP UAE and Oman. "In response to our customer demands, our cloud data centre will provide secure, scalable solutions needed to drive digital business innovation. UAE organisations of all sizes and verticals â€“ from government organisations, to mega-events, and ports and logistics â€“ can now fully digitally transform.
