In this study, terbium-doped ZnO (ZnO:Tb 3+ ) thin films were deposited on ITO-coated glass, quartz and silicon substrates using the RF magnetron sputtering technique fitted with a high-purity (99.99%) Tb 3+ -doped ZnO target (97% ZnO, 3% Tb) for use in organic solar cells as a bi-functional layer. A systematic study of the film crystallization dynamics was carried out through elevated temperature annealing in Ar ambient. The films were characterized using grazing incidence (XRD), Rutherford backscattering spectrometry (RBS), atomic force microscopy, and UV-visible transmittance and photoluminescence measurements at an excitation wavelength of 244 nm. The tunability of size and bandgap of ZnO:Tb 3+ nanocrystals with annealing exhibited quantum confinement effects, which enabled the control of emission characteristics in ZnO:Tb 3+ .
