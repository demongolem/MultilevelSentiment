But he went for Â£15million at one time to Manchester City and he has played for England. I just want to see the lad on the grass.<br />'If he has anything about him he has to try and break into our team. And if it works out, we have a pretty good footballer. I don't sign players without doing background checks. It is something I have done for 15 years. His personality is not a problem. His robustness, we will have see.'<br />Mowbray, a no-nonsense centre-half in his playing days, plans to give Rodwell a new role at the back or as a defensive midfielder, believing his days of playing box-to-box haven't helped his injuries, which have included persistent hamstring problems and knocks to his tendon and ankle.<br />The 27-year-old  was capped three times by England under Fabio Capello and Roy Hodgson<br />'He is at the stage of his career that he has to understand he is mature. I have footballers here who play with knocks, play with sore knees, have treatment after every game and go out on Saturday and run a marathon. That is what footballers have to do.<br />'If you want to play and earn your corn in font of thousands, that is what you have to do. Jack has the opportunity to put on a Blackburn shirt and make a name for himself.'<br />Rodwell will need at least a fortnight's training before being considered for first-team selection and Mowbray has discussed a new position.<br />Blackburn manager Tony Mowbray is looking for a new 'robust' Rodwell at Ewood Park<br />'He is a lovely footballer, plays off both feet, touch and awareness. He's 6ft 3ins, very mobile and can crunches into tackles. I have talked to him, potentially he has been too cavalier in the way he plays and he's picked up injuries.<br />'Using his experience and size, he might pop up playing centre-back sometimes or defensive midfield but not somebody who is tearing everywhere 40 yards across the pitch to do a slide tackle to get him injured.'<br />Rodwell was regarded as the future of English football when he made his international debut against world champions Spain aged 20. He won a Premier League winners' medal at Manchester City but moved to Sunderland to gain regular first-team football. However, the Black Cats suffered two consecutive relegations and Rodwell was frozen out in an attempt to move him on and save on his wages.<br />RELATED ARTICLES<br /
