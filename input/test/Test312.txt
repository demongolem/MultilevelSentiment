Musk's SpaceX could help fund take-private deal for Tesla - NYT (Adds details from the New York Times report, background) Aug 17 (Reuters) - Elon Musk's rocket company, SpaceX, couldhelp fund a bid to take electric car company Tesla Inc private, the New York Times reported on Thursday, quoting peoplefamiliar with the matter. Musk startled Wall Street last week when he said in a tweethe was considering taking the auto company private for $420 pershare and that funding was "secured." He has since said he issearching for funds for the effort. Musk said on Monday that the manager of Saudi Arabia'ssovereign wealth fund had voiced support for the company goingprivate several times, including as recently as two weeks ago,but also said that talks continue with the fund and otherinvestors. The New York Times report said another possibility underconsideration is that SpaceX would help bankroll the Teslaprivatization and would take an ownership stake in the carmaker,according to people familiar with the matter. Musk is the CEO and controlling shareholder of the rocketcompany. Tesla and SpaceX did not respond when Reuters requestedcomment on the matter. In a wide-ranging and emotional interview with the New YorkTimes published late on Thursday, Musk, Tesla's chief executive,described the difficulties over the last year for him as thecompany has tried to overcome manufacturing issues with theModel 3 sedan. https://nyti.ms/2vOkgeM "This past year has been the most difficult and painful yearof my career," he said. "It was excruciating." The loss-making company has been trying to hit productiontargets, but the tweet by Musk opened up a slew of new problemsincluding government scrutiny and lawsuits. The New York Times report said efforts are underway to finda No. 2 executive to help take some of the pressure off Musk,people briefed on the search said. Musk has no plans to relinquish his dual role as chairmanand chief executive officer, he said in the interview. Musk said he wrote the tweet regarding taking Tesla privateas he drove himself on the way to the airport in his Tesla ModelS. He told the New York Times that no one reviewed the tweetbefore he posted it. He said that he wanted to offer a roughly 20 percent premiumover where the stock had been recently trading, which would havebeen about $419. He decided to round up to $420 - a number thathas become code for marijuana in counterculture lore, the reportsaid."It seemed like better karma at $420 than at $419," he saidin the interview. "But I was not on weed, to be clear. Weed isnot helpful for productivity. There's a reason for the word'stoned.' You just sit there like a stone on weed," he said. Some board members recently told Musk to lay off Twitter andrather focus on operations at his companies, according to peoplefamiliar with the matter, the newspaper report said. During the interview, Musk emotionally described theintensity of running his businesses. He told the newspaper thathe works 120 hours a week, sometimes at the expense of notcelebrating his own birthday or spending only a few hours at hisbrother's wedding. "There were times when I didn't leave the factory for threeor four days â€” days when I didn't go outside," he said duringthe interview. "This has really come at the expense of seeing mykids. And seeing friends." To help sleep, Musk sometimes takes Ambien, which concernssome board members, since he has a tendency to conductlate-night Twitter sessions, according to a person familiar withthe board the New York Times reported. "It is often a choice of no sleep or Ambien," he said. (Reporting by Rama Venkat Raman in Bengaluru and BrendanO'Brien in Milwaukee; Editing by Gopakumar Warrier, Bernard Orr) 2018-08-17 09:55:08
