None of the rumors has been confirmed by Samsung as the S9 is still in the prime sale period and thee are hopes for better sales until the end of the year. The S9 itself was well received but the sales were not up to Samsung's expectation. The biggest selling points were the Infinity screen , which received high marks from several reviewers for the quality of the build, and its use. The camera manages to capture impressive slow-motion videos and shots.
Many people have thought that it is not a worthy upgrade from a hardware standpoint since besides finally adding a stereo set of speakers and making the fingerprint scanner better there is nothing amazing. The raw power specs were also disappointing since there performance boost from an S8 is hardly perceivable if you don't play resource-intensive games.
It remains to be seen how the Galaxy S10 will actually look when Samsung will announce it. It expected that it will be unveiled at CES 2019 in January or at the Mobile World Congress in February 2019. More on this topi
