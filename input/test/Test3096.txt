2018-10-30 Development of an MRM Time-Based System for Aircraft Scenario 2018-01-1923 The goal of this research is to build an experimental environment for the Simulation Interoperability Laboratory (SIL) of University of Central Florida (UCF). SIL is researching about multi-resolution modeling(MRM) for especially military field uses. This thesis proposes an MRM time-based system to connect two different commercial combat simulators in an HLA/RTI federation. The work presented describes many definitions and notions related to Multi-Resolution Modeling(MRM) and discusses examples to make better understanding for further researches. MRM is relatively new research, and there are high demands of integrating simulators running as one in the military field. Most military related researches are confidential because they had to use military simulators which military already use it. Hence, there were many limitations to see their process to build MRM system or the results of the research. Two commercial simulators were being participated in this MRM time-based system to overcome these limitations.
