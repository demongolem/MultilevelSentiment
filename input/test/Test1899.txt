Can Wolves repeat the trick (sort of)?<br />Wolves vs Manchester City (Saturday, 12.30pm)<br />Then-Championship side Wolves became the first team to stop Pep Guardiola's irresistible Manchester City from scoring last season (and one of five all year) when they held them to a goalless draw before losing on penalties in the EFL Cup.<br />Nuno Espirito Santos' side romped to the Championship title  last season and with a squad filled with star-name Jorge Mendes clients, were tipped to finish in the top 10 this campaign.<br />But their one weakness looks to be in defence, conceding twice against Everton and Leicester to start the season. The backline will be put to the test and possibly the sword against a juggernaut City team who eased past Arsenal 2-0 before taking apart Huddersfield 6-1.<br />Pep Guardiola's Manchester City were held to a 0-0 draw by Wolves in last season's EFL Cup<br />Will it be lift-off for the Unai Emery era?<br />Arsenal vs West Ham (Saturday, 3pm)<br />Two defeats from two games, albeit against Pep Guardiola's champions and away at Stamford Bridge, have seen the post-Arsene Wenger era get off to a slow start.<br />Talk of Unai Emery being under pressure is far too premature but after the extenuating circumstances of the opening two games, Arsenal fans will expect three points against a disorganised West Ham side.<br />The Hammers splashed out big this window, signing Â£40million winger Felipe Anderson but all eyes will be on free transfer Jack Wilshere, who is returning to his boyhood club for the first time. It will be interesting to see the reception the midfielder gets from the home fans.<br />Unai Emery will be hoping to get his first win as Arsenal manager at home to West Ham<br />Can Richarlison continue his fast start?<br />Bournemouth vs Everton (Saturday, 3pm)<br />Eyebrows were raised and jaws dropped all across the Premier League when Everton paid a staggering Â£44million to sign Richarlison from Watford.<br />The Brazilian winger showed flashes of his potential during his first six months at Vicarage Road but soon faded and failed to score another Premier League goal after November.<br />At Goodison Park it's been a different story though, with three goals from his opening two matches including a debut brace away at Wolves.  He can pay back another instalment of the fee by netting against Bournemouth who are looking to make it three wins from three at the Vitality Stadium.<br />Richarlison has scored three times in his first two matches as an Everton player<br />Far-too-early relegation six-pointer?<br />Huddersfield vs Cardiff (Saturday, 3pm)<br />The least glamorous of the Premier League matches this weekend and perhaps an early relegation six-pointer at the John Smith's Stadium.<br />Cardiff, with a squad filled with Championship players, were everyone's tip to finish bottom this season and Huddersfield look set for a difficult second season in the top flight after David Wagner worked miracles to keep them up last campaign.<br />Neil Warnock's side are the ones with a foothold, having gained a gritty point at home to Newcastle last time out thanks to Kenedy's stoppage-time penalty miss, while the Terriers have lost two in two and conceded nine in the process.<br />It's unlikely to be pretty in Yorkshire but a win for either side could be a huge confidence boost for the relegation battle ahead.<br />Neil Warnock's Cardiff secured their first point of the season against Newcastle at home<br />Puel to show Saints (and Leicester) what they're missing?<br />Southampton vs Leicester (Saturday, 3pm)<br />Claude Puel returns to his former club once again on Saturday having been harshly sacked by Saints at the end of the 2016-17 season. Without him, Southampton struggled and his replacement Mauricio Pellegrino was soon replaced himself by Mark Hughes, who just managed to steer them away from the drop.<br />The Frenchman has done a steady job with his new club Leicester but was strangely linked with the sack at the start of this season given the club's trigger-happy owners.<br />Unfairly treated wherever he goes it seems, Puel can prove a point to both his current and former employers with a results on the south Coast.<br />Claude Puel was unfairly sacked by Southampton and is back at his old stomping ground<br />Will Klopp keep things fresh?<br />Liverpool vs Brighton (Saturday, 5.30pm)<br />Mohamed Salah, Sadio Mane and Roberto Firmino weren't actually at their fluid best against Crystal Palace last time out but managed to put it together when it mattered most, Mane netting a late second as they emerged from Selhurst Park with a 2-0 win.<br />Jurgen Klopp has an embarrassment of riches in attack though and could even be tempted to freshen things up at home to Brighton - with Xherdan Shaqiri pushing for his first start and Daniel Sturridge looking to come in from the cold.<br />Xherdan Shaqiri (centre) will be hoping to force his way into Liverpool's team on Saturday<br />The Liverpool boss admitted earlier this summer that he expects to be unpopular with some of his squad amid fierce competition for starting spots but knows he needs a deep squad to claw back the gap on last season's runaway train Manchester City. Keeping his substitutes on their toes could prove valuable for the run-in.<br />In their way stand a Brighton side high on confidence having secured a morale-boosting victory over Manchester United on Sunday. It's the sort of match Liverpool might have drawn last season but one they can't afford to if they are serious contenders.<br />Will it be Zaha vs Harry the Hornet round three?<br />Watford vs Crystal Palace (1.30pm)<br />Wilfried Zaha will come face-to-face with his greatest enemy once again when Crystal Palace travel to Vicarage Road to take on Watford.<br />Accusations of diving have followed Zaha around throughout his Premier League career but no one has got under his skin quite like the Watford mascot did two seasons ago, when he threw himself to the ground to mock the Palace winger. Roy Hodgson has already got a dig in early, calling Harry the Hornet a 'disgrace' ahead of kick-off.<br />Harry the Hornet threw himself to the ground to mock Wilfried Zaha in the 2016-17 season<br />On a more serious note, this is the sort of game that Zaha was single-handedly winning for Crystal Palace last season. Hodgson needs one of his forwards to step up and provide the firepower that will ease the burden on his talisman.<br />Christian Benteke should be that man but the striker continues to look a shadow of the player that starred for Aston Villa and was hooked for Alexander Sorloth during the defeat by Liverpool. A goal for the big Belgian on Sunday will do wonders for his confidence.<br />How will Burnley bounce back from Thursday?<br />Fulham vs Burnley (Sunday, 4pm)<br />Burnley endured a energy-sapping trip to Greece on Thursday night, falling to a 3-1 defeat by Olympiacos in the first leg of their Europa League qualifier.<br />Sean Dyche's side outperformed all expectations by finishing seventh and qualifying for the Europa League last season. But as it has proven to other teams in the past (see Newcastle 2012-13, Swansea 2013-14, Hull 2014-15), making it to Europe is sometimes a curse rather than a blessing.<br />The Clarets lack squad depth and head into their third straight Sunday-following-Thursday clash as they travel to Craven Cottage to take on Fulham. Newly-promoted Fulham have suffered two defeats from two so far this season but will fancy their chances against a tired Burnley side hurting from Thursday's defeat.<br />Burnley fell to a painful 3-1 defeat in Greece by Olympiacos on Thursday evening<br />Will Sarri-ball be in full effect at St James' Park?<br />Newcastle vs Chelsea (Sunday 4pm)<br />Maurizio Sarri took over at Chelsea just six weeks ago so it's understandable that there have been some growing pains as his new players adapt, evidenced by the suicidal high line deployed against Arsenal last time out.<br />But he's emerged with two wins from his opening two matches in England and new signings Jorginho and Mateo Kovacic look set to form a formidable midfield trio alongside N'Golo Kante.<br />The Italian's style will continue to take shape as they face Rafa Benitez's Newcastle at St James' Park on Saturday. Eden Hazard will be pushing for his first start of the season and will be licking his lips against Newcastle's full back duo Paul Dummett and Javier Manquillo.<br />Jorginho is one of the key cogs in Chelsea's engine room under new boss Maurizio Sarri<br />Can Pochettino end his Old Trafford misery?<br />Manchester United vs Tottenham (Monday, 8pm)<br />All eyes will be on Jose Mourinho after Manchester United's disastrous 3-2 defeat by Brighton last time out but if history is anything to go by, he'll get things back on track in the final game of matchday three.<br />Mauricio Pochettino, the man in the opposite dugout, has yet to claim a point in four trips to United as Tottenham manager.
