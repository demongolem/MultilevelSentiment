,<br />Aug. 24, 2018<br />/PRNewswire/ -- There's a lot of talk about making sure everyone is treated fair and equally, especially from a business standpoint. But is equality really what is going to best help a business succeed?<br />Brandon Frere<br />, successful entrepreneur and CEO of several companies, has some words about the need to balance equality and equity in a business.<br />Continue Reading<br />digitalista/Bigstock.com<br />&quot;Every employee brings with them a new opportunity for the company. They might need some sort of accommodation to achieve their top productivity, but they're a part of the team in a business. It's the job of the business owner to take care of employees because they're the ones who take care of your business,&quot; said Frere. Equality means every employee gets the same thing. The same desk, the same training, all of the same tools to use. But each employee is a unique person and won't need the same things to reach maximum productivity. An employee that suffers from back issues might need a standing desk or another might need more hands-on training to gain a new skill because of how they learn.<br />But not every situation will need specifics for it to be fair. The need for equality versus equity is all about giving people what is fair. If there's a spot opening up in a department that might be best filled by someone already working there, giving everyone an equal shot at it is what would be fair. &quot;Doing right by employees to get the most out of them is a good shot at a successful business and a healthy work environment. My employees come first in my business because they chose to come and work for me, and I want to show them that that is appreciated,&quot; said Frere.<br />About Frere Enterprises<br /
