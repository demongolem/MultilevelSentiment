Hyderabad: Many shops in the posh model markets constructed by Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation (GHMC) in different parts of the city are gathering dust as they are yet to be occupied by shopkeepers for different reasons.
The municipal corporation has constructed 32 markets out of the proposed 42 markets in different areas. The rest could not be constructed and completed due to site disputes, delay by contractors and other reasons.
GHMC had planned construction of 42 model markets at different areas in the city at a total cost of Rs 20.33 crore. Construction of 32 markets is already completed and auctioned as per GOMS 25. There were guidelines reserving few shops for different communities, including SCs, STs, BCs and others.
Each model market has a ground floor with seven shops â€“ each shop spread over 70 to 140 sq.ft, and eight shops at first floor for which parking, toilet and other basic minimum facilities are being provided.
The markets will be offering vegetables, non-vegetarian products, bakery, sweet shops, medical shop, mobile, electronics, dry cleaning, Internet cafÃ©, MeeSeva, hair salon, beauty parlours and others for the convenience of the citizens.
Depending on the area and size, each market was constructed with a cost of about Rs 50 lakh and the municipal corporation was expecting nearly Rs 1.5 crore towards rent from the shops in all the markets.
However, many shops in the 32 markets are yet to be occupied due to different reasons. In a few cases, the shopkeepers are not willing to pay the mandatory six-month advance and in other cases, the rents are higher than the market value.
For instance, the shops in Kukatpally market are being offered for rents higher than the market value, which is making the shopkeepers desist from opting for such establishments.
This apart, the shops are allotted for a period of one year and the shopkeepers have to apply for renewal after every year.
On the contrary, an official in the GHMC Estates section said majority of the shops in all the 32 markets have been auctioned and allotted, save for a few. In cases, where the shopkeepers have raised issues over payments of advance, the respective Deputy Municipal Commissioners have been asked to report the same, so that the issue could be taken up for discussion with the higher authorities in head office, he added
