Even though Netflix is becoming increasingly renowned for its 'quantity over quality' approach to making content, it's not every day that the streaming service has to ask for a shot at redemption with a superhero show. Even so, it's probably fair to say that in the grand scheme of things, \\u00a0 season 2 of\\u00a0 Iron Fist needs to be good.
As such, it looks like Netflix have largely listened to people's complaints about\\u00a0the show's first season, serving up an action-packed, martial arts-fueled trailer for their second stab at getting the character right.\\u00a0

The trailer sees Danny Rand locked in battle with Davos, his ex-training partner and the person he originally claimed the Iron Fist from. However, Davos is looking to take the fist back for his own, more nefarious uses, as Danny looks to find balance in his newfound life as a superhero and a member of The Defenders.
As is the way with Netflix's Marvel universe, there's plenty in the way of character interaction between the different superhero storylines, with Luke Cage's partner Misty Knight featuring prominently throughout.
Iron Fist season 2 premieres on September 7
