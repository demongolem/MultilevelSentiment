H'Hen Nie has committed to a personal fundraising goal of US$22,000 to fund the creation of a Room to Read library stocked with quality reading materials in Lam Dong Province, Vietnam, as well as supporting 50 girls across Asia and Africa to complete secondary school and develop key life skills through the Room to Read's Girls' Education Program.
H'Hen Nie's philanthropic commitment is aligned with Room to Read's global movement Active for Education, which encourages supporters around the world to activate their body and mind through personalised fundraising campaigns.
As a Room to Read ambassador, H'Hen Nie will participate in awareness raising activities to advocate Room to Read's programs in literacy and girls' education, which enable students to reach their full potential and contribute to society.
"Growing up as an ethnic minority in Vietnam, I have seen firsthand that education is the only way to break the cycle of poverty," said H'Hen Nie. "I want children everywhere to flourish, dream big and have the resilience to overcome obstacles."
H'Hen Nie is of the Ede group, an ethnic minority in Vietnam and comes from a family of farmers. Her passion for Room to Read's mission stems from her personal experience overcoming obstacles, including working multiple jobs as a housekeeper and waitress, to finance her own education and pursue her dreams. As reigning Miss Universe Vietnam she has actively championed numerous social causes and has participated in community activities throughout Vietnam.
Founded in 2000 on the belief that World Change Starts with Educated Children, Room to Read's innovative model focuses on deep, systemic transformation within schools in low-income countries during the two time periods that are most critical in a child's schooling: early primary school for literacy acquisition and secondary school for girls' education.
Room to Read has benefited 12.4 million children across more than 20,000 communities in 15 countries. Theo ND
