All middle and high school students in Caroline County schools will receive Google Chromebooks this year as part of the school division's Digital 1:1 initiative.
But parents in the county are confused about who is responsible for loss or damage to the devices, which division Assistant Superintendent Sarah Calveric said will be delivered in late August and will go home with students in early September.
Others are concerned about being forced to pay full price to replace a damaged device.
"Information is not being properly sent home to parents," said Kim Foley-Carroll, the parent of a senior at Caroline High School. "There are just a lot of unanswered questions."
As of Thursday, there were 93 comments on a Facebook post about the Chromebooks.
Students returning to school the week of Aug. 13 brought home among their new school year paperwork a "Digital Citizenship Agreement" which they and their parents or guardians are asked to sign. The agreement states that the student will be financially responsible for the replacement cost should the Chromebook be lost, stolen or damaged.
Students are also being asked to pay a $40 technology fee, per student.
On social media, parents expressed confusion over what the $40 covers if it does not cover replacement due to loss or damage.
In an interview, Calveric said the technology fee covers "all events that may occur associated with the Chromebooks, with the exception of household fires." She said there is another exception, which is "willful neglect."
"If a student repeatedly damages their Chomebook and we have evidence to demonstrate this ongoing behavior, there would be at that time be a charge to replace the screen or keyboard, things of that nature," Calveric said.
She repeated that the $40 technology feeâ€”which she compared with the annual cost of car insuranceâ€”does cover "accidental damage."
But the section of the school division's website dedicated to answering questions about the Chromebooks states, "Just like textbooks, if a device is misused or intentionally damaged the student may be expected to replace the device."
"You can't use the word 'may,'â€‰" Foley-Carroll said. "You cannot pick and choose who you're going to make pay and who you're not. That's not right."
She said she reviewed the Student Code of Conduct that her son brought home and found prices listed for repairing and replacing the devices.
"It's $225 to replace the entire Chromebook," Foley-Carroll said. "$100 to replace the screen, $50 to replace the keyboard and $40 to replace the AC adaptor cable."
She said she worries about parents in Carolineâ€”where more than 50 percent of students qualify for free or reduced lunchâ€”being required to pay those rates. And she thinks that too much of the information about the devices is being relayed through the website and social media.
"Not all parents have access to social media or internet access, period, or have time to read the entire student code of conduct," she said. "And I think it's wrong to rely on that technology for something like this, with this magnitude of money involved."
Students are not permitted to opt out of receiving the Chromebooks, the school's website states.
Calveric said the school division communicated on "multiple levels" with parents about the upcoming 1:1 initiative, including automated phone calls and flyers sent through the mail.
She said that parents who are unable to pay the $40 technology fee at once can make payments of $10 each quarter.
"We also recognize that some of our students are identified anonymously or confidentially as free or reduced lunch recipients," Calveric said. "We have notified all of our administrators and bookkeepers that if they have a scenario where a student or parent requests financial support or a waiver [of the technology fee], we are equipped to do that on an individual basis."
The division ordered 1,500 new Chromebooks to supplement the 1,371 already owned by the schools. Each student in grades 6 through 12 will receive a device and is expected to bring it back and forth between school and home every day.
"Our expectation is that these are very similar to a textbook in that it is a resource critical to a positive learning environment being established every day," Calveric said. "We want them to be utilized both within the schools and and within the home environment."
Students will also be expected to come to class with the devices fully charged, she said.
Calveric said the devices will be pre-loaded with all course content and will replace traditional textbooks, although there will be a set of textbooks available in the classrooms.
At a joint meeting of the school board and the board of supervisors in July, Caroline supervisors approvedâ€”but by a vote of 3â€“2â€”reappropriating $357,659 from last year's textbook fund into this year's textbook fund to purchase new math and history books.
Calveric said the cost of the Chromebooks is "supported" by a funds from the Virginia Public School Authority.
Schools finance director Marcia Stevens said the devices were ordered last monthâ€”which was the start of fiscal year 2019â€”for a total of $277,125. She said the division's budget for fiscal year 2019 includes $371,000 in VPSA grant funds.
Calveric said Caroline followed models of digital 1:1 initiatives set by school divisions in New Kent, Goochland, Henrico and Chesterfield counties.
