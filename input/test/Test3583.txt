Pamela has kindly written a message below about the Cell & Gene Therapy conference and what attendees can gain from the two day event.
Quick Snapshot:
This conference is another excellent opportunity to meet and network with experts and colleagues from around the world and to build the personal relationships and connections that are so essential to moving the science, techniques and technology of Advanced Therapy Medicinal Products studies forward.
The conference includes sessions that are designed to illuminate current challenges we are all facing. These include: how to address emerging, new regulatory requirements; how to improve data management and modelling; and how to advance current research techniques in order to reduce the time and costs of pre-clinical and clinical drug discovery.
