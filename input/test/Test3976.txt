Summary
Global Markets Direct's latest Pharmaceutical and Healthcare disease pipeline guide OpioidInduced Constipation OIC Pipeline Review, H2 2018, provides an overview of the OpioidInduced Constipation OIC Toxicology pipeline landscape.
Opioids are effective pain relievers, but often have the side effect of constipation. These medicines affect the gastrointestinal tract in a variety of ways. Opioids increase the amount of time it takes stool to move through the gastric system. They increase nonpropulsive contractions in the middle of the small intestine jejunum and decrease longitudinal propulsive peristalsis motions critical to moving food through the intestines. This results in food that fails to travel through the digestive tract. Opioids are also able to partially paralyze the stomach gastroparesis so that food remains in the digestive organ for a longer period of time. Additionally opioids reduce digestive secretions and decrease the urge to defecate. Symptoms of OIC include feeling and being sick, tiredness and lethargy, appetite loss, feeling depressed.
