What are the pros and cons of AI? Share 17 Aug, 2018 We weigh up the benefits and the negatives of the technology that's already changing business
Artificial intelligence is either the technology to bring about the fourth industrial revolution or it's the technology that will see humans enslaved by robot overlords.
At least that is how it seems to be portrayed in the media. Elon Musk once said that AI was an "existential threat" to human civilisation igniting a Twitter spat with Mark Zuckerberg, who thinks AI will deliver many improvements to our lives over the next 10 years.
A more rational opinion came from Deep Nishar, the senior managing partner at SoftBank Investment Advisers. Speaking at the London Tech week earlier this year, he said that AI's impact was inevitable. See related Machine learning vs AI
"For organisations, AI has to be infused in everything you do, whether you're an insurance company, a bank or a builder," he said. "We have to recognise that the only constant in life is change and that change is happening faster today than it did 50-years-ago."
So if artificial intelligence is the inevitable next step for businesses, what are its pros and cons? Pros
AI is set to dominate the business, consumer and public sector landscape over the next few years with technologists predicting that soon we will be surrounded by IoT devices capable of performing mundane tasks and speeding up complex ones. Indeed, many of the benefits AI offer will centre around the workplace. Improve efficiency
The value of data is now as important to business as oil once was and there is a need to process this data quickly and accurately for real time results. A good example of this type of AI is being used by DeepMind to diagnose sight-threatening eye conditions as accurately as the world's best clinicians.
Working with London-based Moorfields Eye Hospital and UCL's Institute of Ophthalmology, the results of their research could pave the way for the rollout of AI systems in hospitals across the country. The AI system reduces the time doctors spend studying thousands of eye scans and can diagnose patients within seconds. Eradicate human error
From lapses in concentration to simple mistakes, even the best of us are prone to errors. But an artificially intelligent machine built to perform a specific task has no such idiosyncrasies.
Online grocer Ocado uses automated machines in its warehouse, controlling thousands of robots , communicating with them 10 times a second to coordinate the movement of hundreds of thousands of crates. Smart technology
Much like Ocado, AI will be used to power much of our automated services in the future. From self-driving cars, that use AI to navigate roads and asses obstructions, to smart cities that are predicted to greatly improve our environments.
An AI machine's ability to process large data sets quickly and accurately will be vital for many smart technologies and environment to operate. An example of this is already in operation on many top range smartphones, where AI operates in the background constantly optimising its device. Cons
As Spiderman's uncle Ben famously said, "with great power, comes great responsibility" and this is certainly true of AI.
In 2016, an industry-wide organisation including five Silicon Valley giants was formed, known as the Partnership on Artificial Intelligence to Benefit People and Society . This body works to promote the fair and ethical development of artificial intelligence technologies that have the potential to bring as much disruption as it will benefit. Job losses
This is arguably the number one downside to AI consistently highlighted as a doom and gloom scenario were workers are laid off, unable to outperform machines.
Reports on this are conflicting. A recent study from PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) argued that AI will create just as many jobs as it culls . However, the report detailed that the new technologies will have an uneven effect on industries.
Where sectors like healthcare and education were predicted to benefit, laborious positions such as manufacturing and transportation operators were estimated to see the largest decreases in jobs. Former chess world champion Garry Kasparov has said these jobs losses were necessary to progress, arguing that it is outweighed by the societal good that AI can achieve. Robot bosses
If you have an issue with your current human boss, be thankful that he isn't a cold, emotionless machine because AI is already being used to monitor work productivity.
In what seems like the scary nightmares of a dystopian future, IBM's Watson has been using AI and Watson Analytics to decide if employees are worthy of a pay rise, a bonus or a promotion by looking at the experience and past projects of employees to judge the qualities and skills that individuals might have to serve the company in the future. Man-made error
Although AI can virtually remove human error from processes, it can still exist in the code, along with bias and prejudice. Being largely algorithm based, the technology can be coded to have a negative impact on certain demographics and discriminate against people.
Worryingly, if security is not 100%, hackers can take advantage of AI's thirst for knowledge. For example, Microsoft's ill-fated chatbot, Tay Tweets, had to be taken down after only 16 hours after it started to tweet racist and inflammatory content -- ideas it repeated from other Twitter users.
