Fort Myers beach has become carpeted with seaweed that needs to be removed by bulldozers<br />Dealing with the tide<br />The red tide has also stained the waters at Fort Myers Beach, 30 minutes away from Sanibel Island.<br />But here there's another problem: the beach is full of another type of algae, a much larger seaweed that piles up on the shore.<br />"It's also a consequence of nutrient loading," Dr Bartleson explains, "the grazers that could keep it in check have been killed or displaced by low salinity water or killed or disabled by red tide."<br />The seaweed spreads like a carpet along miles of beach.<br />The bloom is proving to be a blight on tourism.<br />"A lot of people come from up north and since they are coming for the beach, they don't have anything to do," says Neiva Romero, who works in a Mexican restaurant close to the beach.<br />"We don't have people at the restaurant, it's really bad."<br />Tourists who stop coming will avoid an unpleasant experience, but locals have no choice but to deal with the tide.<br />John Mayberry, a native from Fort Myers, says that although in recent days it has improved, a couple of weeks ago the smell of dead fish was so strong that it reached his car while driving near the bridge that leads to the beach.<br />"It's depressing," he says.<br /
