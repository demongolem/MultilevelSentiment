MUMBAI: Isuzu motors, Japanese car manufacturer, has signed on former South African cricketer Jonty Rhodes as the brand ambassador to promote the brand and its latest product V-Cross in India. The brand will complete six years on 21 August 2018 in the Indian market.
The company began its manufacturing operations in April 2016 in Sri City, spread over an area of 107 acres in the state of Andhra Pradesh.
The brand has brought the lesser used term pick-up in trend with their lifestyle and adventure pick-up, Isuzu D-MAX V-Cross. Isuzu has establishing itself rapidly as an important player in the Indian pick-up and utility vehicle market. The association brings together a distinct combination of ISUZU's thrust on 'Never Stop' philosophy and Jonty's strategy & excellence of being 'game-changer' in the world of Cricket. Isuzu launched its latest commercial, featuring Jonty Rhodes, underscoring the message 'Be the Game Changer' at a press conference held in Mumbai on 16 August 2018.
Isuzu Motors India VP- service, customer care, EA and PR J Shankar Srinivas said, "A lot of people are well travelled in this country. At the time of launch we didn't have to convince the adventure enthusiast and the off-road communities much. With a predominant commercial pick-up segment already prevalent in this country, we needed a prime mover and found out that there is no lifestyle pick-up in this country that was really catching on." In terms of marketing and promotions the brand is primarily focussing on TV advertising. The company's total investment outlay is Rs 3000 crore.
According to Srinivas, the Indian market is certainly a tough market when it comes to convincing a customer about the value of a product in terms of pricing because Indians are the best negotiators in the world.
Considering the base that is very small the brand has grown by 100 per cent in 2017 compared to 2016 and this year would be another 60 per cent compared to 2017.
According to the Society of Indian Automobiles Manufacturers (SIAM), the pick-up trucks is the fastest growing and the largest segment (by volume) in the commercial vehicle market in India. It has grown from 81,622 in 2011-12 to 255,599 in 2017-18.
Isuzu Motors India deputy managing director Ken Takashima said, "Jonty perfectly represents the brand's values and his association encapsulates what we intend to do in this country. Jonty Rhodes, an internationally known sportsman, brings with him unique qualities that differentiated him as a 'game-changer' in the international cricket. The V-Cross, lifestyle & adventure pick-up, has been a catalyst in bringing about a new lease of life to the people and adventure enthusiasts in India. The Indian pick-up market is growing significantly and we have been witnessing a strong inclination towards the V-Cross. We are happy to have carved a niche in the Indian utility vehicle market. We are thrilled and excited to associate with Jonty and I am sure this will make the brand & the V-Cross even more exciting and aspirational in the days to come." tag
