Tweet 5 Species That Interesting article, but VERY misleading. The only species isted there that truly doesn't need a male is the snake. All the rest of them have to take on the characteristics of (or as in the frogs, actually become) male. What author Boyce desribes as "reproduction" in the starfish is not. It IS regeneration, and a nuymber of species have that capability - though not the extent the starfish does. And of course, the single-celled world is all asexual reproduction (though some bacteria cna exchange genetic material, so I suppose that could be called sexual reproduction (which one is male and which one is female?)) @mjdesart Â» 17 Aug '18, 2am 5 Species That Don't Require a Male to Reproduce #care2 [link] @melyndaqcasl87 Â» 17 Aug '18, 1am 5 Species That Don't Require a Male to Reproduce #care2 [link] @MalditoMendez Â» 16 Aug '18, 9pm 5 Species That Don't Require a Male to Reproduce #care2 [link] @MNTRYJOSEPH Â» 16 Aug '18, 8pm 5 Species That Don't Require A Male To Reproduce [link] @CharlesALundqu1 Â» 16 Aug '18, 7pm 5 Species That Don't Require a Male to Reproduce | Care2 Causes [link] @Koniginusagi Â» 16 Aug '18, 6pm 5 Species That Don't Require a Male to Reproduce #care2 [link] @redhed67 Â» 16 Aug '18, 5pm 5 Species That Do #NOT Require a #Male to Reproduce #care2 [link] @mynefeli Â» 16 Aug '18, 5pm 5 Species That Don't Require a Male to Reproduce #care2 [link] @iambatmandoug Â» 16 Aug '18, 4pm 5 Species That Don't Require a Male to Reproduce #care2 [link] @SaylorRasmussen Â» 16 Aug '18, 4pm 5 Species That Don't Require a Male to Reproduce #care2 [link] @rhondababy1953 Â» 16 Aug '18, 3pm 5 Species That Don't Require a Male to Reproduce #care2 [link] @Nicole_Cannelle Â» 16 Aug '18, 3pm 5 Species That Don't Require a Male to Reproduce #care2 [link] @AnnaRossar Â» 16 Aug '18, 3pm 5 Species That Don't Require a Male to Reproduce #care2 [link] @hugwildlife Â» 16 Aug '18, 3pm 5 Species That Don't Require a Male to Reproduce #care2 [link] @Osterkatze666 Â» 16 Aug '18, 3pm 5 Species That Don't Require a Male to Reproduce #care2 [link] No men, no cry?! 5 Big Brands Who Don't Own Their Exact Match .C... namepros.com 16 Aug '18, 1pm namemarket said: â†‘ I always find it very interesting how so many companies with many millions of dollars in funding do not...
