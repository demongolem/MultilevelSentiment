Asheville High travels to Franklin on Friday in the football season opener for both teams. Last year, Franklin defeated Asheville High 33-8. (Photo: Matt Burkhartt, Matt Burkhartt/mburkhartt@citize) Asheville at Franklin Last Year: Franklin won 33-8 Notes: The opening week of the 2018 season should offer a clear benchmark for both Asheville and particularly Franklin, which enters the year with big expectations but plenty of fresh faces. Franklin returns six starters from last year's 13-1 team. The Panthers, who defeated the Cougars by 25 points in 2017, will find out quickly what their offense is made of behind new quarterback Blake Gibson. Running back Isaac Dewey looks to replace the output of three top running backs from last year, including Brock Kloeppel, who rushed for nearly 3,500 yards in his final two seasons. Dewey (48 carries, 224 yards) will miss having the services of senior offensive lineman Kade Chapman â€“ now at Christ School â€“ but senior Josh Blackburn should be able to create some holes through the line while Tyler Harrison, Bailey Watts and 6-foot-2 tight end Mason Sequoya offer Gibson targets downfield. Franklin's inexperienced defense â€“ four returning starters - will have its hands full with Asheville High quarterback Three Hillier. The junior passed for a school-record 2,570 yards last season and has dangerous receivers Trevon Robinson (48 catches, 952 yards) and Famous Paisley returning. The Cougars return a stout defensive line behind Marvin Pearson and Kaliq Moore and will be going after the Panthers' new quarterback. Franklin is never an easy place to play, and Memorial Stadium will be rocking Week 1. The Panthers defeated Asheville High last year for the first time since 2007 and hope to start a winning streak of their own. Prediction: Asheville by 3 Erwin at Mitchell Last Year: Mitchell won 21-14 Notes: Few WNC teams finished the 2017 regular season hotter than Erwin. After an 0-4 start, the Warriors won their final six games, eventually falling just short of a first-round upset over A.L. Brown. They return 14 starters from last year's team, including senior quarterback Kendrick Weaver, who finished last season with nearly 2,000 total yards and 25 touchdowns. They enter 2018 with established starters on the offensive and defensive line such as Jackson Gouge, Dillon Luther, Dylan Crook and Tristian Brank. They also sport one of the area's top receivers, Simeon Thompson, who hauled in 45 catches for 810 yards and 10 touchdowns last season. Mitchell, on the other hand, enters this year looking to replace a once in a generation talent. Gone is quarterback Ben Young, who finished his historic career with 11,551 total yards and 144 touchdowns. The Mountaineers will have only seven seniors and nine returning starters on their 30-man roster. Senior quarterback Noah Pittman and running back Landon Miller look to lead the offense with Miller also anchoring the defense after producing 74 tackles as a defensive back in 2017. All-Conference lineman Hudson Boone will need to be on the attack against Erwin's high-powered offense and will look to create holes in the offense. If Mitchell can slow the tempo with its Multiple Wing-T running attack, it should be able to eat big chunks of time and keep Weaver and the Erwin offense off the field. Prediction: Erwin by 7 Enka at Owen Last Year: Enka won 14-12 Notes: A Week 1 win would be huge for either Enka or Owen, two programs that combined for four wins last season and finished near the bottom in their conferences. Enka coach Jeff Frady has never won more than three games as he enters his sixth season at the helm and likely needs a win over Owen to potentially accomplish that feat as the Jets enter their second year in the competitive WMAC. The Jets return 12 players from last year's 3-8 squad, including dynamic running back Jackson Smith, who looks to build on his 747 yards gained in 2017. Week 1 will also be a test for new quarterback, junior Shannon Gacusana, who will run the veer option offense for the Jets. Senior defensive end Zeb Gunter returns to lead the defense along with senior defensive lineman Hunter Rivers. Owen enters the 2018 season on the heels of its third straight 1-9 finish, but fourth-year coach Nathan Padgett returns 14 starters and a renewed hope for success. Audun Meyers (76-160, 1,037 yards, 15 TDs, 13 INTs) returns at quarterback but may split time with rising sophomore Caleb Scott, who looks to play a bigger role in the offense this season. Otis Mallory, an all-conference player last year, makes the move from defensive end to linebacker and looks to improve on his 79-tackle season in 2017. Mallory and incoming junior Caleb Wells will play together at the running back position. Top receivers Ty Davidson and Frank Walsh return after combining for 47 catches and 751 yards. Prediction: Enka by 1 Reynolds at South Durham Last Year: Reynolds won 50-9 Notes: Last year's win over South Durham was quarterback Alex Flinn's coming out party, throwing for 294 yards and four touchdowns on the way to a 41-point Rockets win. This year, Flinn - an East Carolina commit - is established as a top quarterback in N.C after leading his team to the 3AA state title game. Another dominating Week 1 win over the Spartans seems more than likely. South Durham returns some talent from last year's 3-8 season, including senior quarterback Taron Beauford (53-95, 841 yards, 13 touchdowns). Beauford can also run the ball, adding 454 yards rushing last year, and will have leading rusher, senior Kevin Pierce Jr. (469 yards, 3 touchdowns), in the backfield with him. Week 1 should be a good warmup for Reynolds, who will then face perennial power Shelby in Week 2 in its home opener. The Golden Lions handed the Rockets their only regular season loss of 2017. Reynolds should be an exciting team to watch this season with several Division I prospects and commits, including 6-foot-7 offensive lineman and Wake Forest commit CJ Elmonus, linebacker Eli Hembree, defensive back Seth Eberhardt and versatile running back I'dre Bell. Bell rushed for 1,038 yards last season and added 54 catches for 693 yards. Pick: Reynolds by 28 Watauga at Roberson Last Year: Watauga won 35-34 Notes: Last year's one-point loss to Watauga was the beginning of Roberson's close game woes in 2017. The Rams were on the wrong side of five games decided by six points or less, but a Week 1 win would give the Rams necessary momentum in 2018. Like last season, Watauga - which finished 10-3 last season - will sport a prolific running game behind junior quarterback Anderson Castle, who rushed for 1,456 yards as a sophomore while passing for 890 yards and nine touchdowns. Next to him in the backfield will be junior Bryce Satterfield (1,447 yards, 25 touchdowns) and junior Jaiden Bond (696 yards, 4 TDs). Roberson will be ready for the Pioneers rushing attack, leaning on linemen Troy Tobe and Christain Nunez to get the defense off the field. While Watauga plans to run the ball, expect to see a more balanced attack from Roberson behind senior quarterback Ty Gossett (2,528 yards, 26 TDs). Jordon Proctor-Bates will see plenty of touches as the Rams' new starting running back, and Gossett will have good options in the passing game with Kobe Miles and Shak Hill. Pick: Roberson by 1 Buy Photo
Tuscola hosts Swain on Friday in the football opener for both schools. Pictured here are Tuscola's Joey Diienno and Brayden Monday before a game last season. (Photo: Matt Burkhartt/mburkhartt@citize) Swain County at Tuscola Last Year: Tuscola won 21-14 Notes: This will be the sixth straight season Tuscola and Swain County have faced off in nonconference play with the Mountaineers earning a 4-1 record against the Maroon Devils. First-year head coach JT Postell hopes to keep the recent series record lopsided in his teams' favor as he begins his first season with Tuscola. The Mountaineers should be able to use their size and speed in the running game to keep a young Swain County team off-balance. The Maroon Devils return only eight starters from last year, including three on defense. Bailee Ewart (891 yards on 97 carries) will lead Tuscola's run game behind junior quarterback Hunter Bryson, who will get his shot as a starter after playing as a defensive back last season. Senior tight end and Division I prospect Brayden Monday will give Bryson a big target in the middle. Look for junior Connor Hyatt or sophomore Damien Lossiah to both take snaps under center for Swain County as they continue to look for their starter. The strength for Swain County lies in its offensive and defensive line, anchored by junior Nick Millsaps and Jake Langston. Sophomore Bryce Sain (385 yards) and Ian Brooks (285 yards) will return as the Maroon Devils' best options. Pick: Tuscola by 7
Cherokee opens its football season Friday at home in its first game since winning a state championship last season. (Photo: CHEROKEE ONE FEATHER) North Buncombe at Cherokee Last Year: Cherokee won 36-10 Notes: The Braves begin their state title defense against North Buncombe, a team they defeated by 26 points last season and finished with a 1-10 record. It's a slightly different Cherokee team that returns this season, including replacing standout quarterback Tye Mintz for junior Bobby Crowe. The Braves' offense will lean on running back Isaiah Evans, who rushed for over 1,4000 yards as a junior and wideout Cade Mintz - a rising junior who hauled in 47 catches for 1,129 yards and 10 touchdowns as a sophomore. Evans rushed for 155 yards and two scores last year in the win over the Black Hawks. North Buncombe fans will get their first chance to see the offense under quarterback Caden Higgins, who missed all of last season with a broken ankle. The Black Hawks will need to sustain long scoring drives to stay in this game, leaning on running backs Skylar Justras (725 yards) and Dawson Fender (110 yards), who are tasked with replacing former running back Nick Lisenbee. He accounted for over 1,200 yards last season. North Buncombe will also be filling a big hole at linebacker with the loss of Emory Pennell, who transferred to Erwin in the spring. Pick: Cherokee by 10 Hendersonville at North Henderson Last Year: Hendersonville won 58-7 Notes: Last season, Alex Williford racked up 303 passing yards and three touchdowns as the Bearcats routed North Henderson in the 2017 season opener. This year, Hendersonville is without its senior quarterback but plans to put up as many points against a young Knights team. Both junior Woodson Hunter and sophomore Triston Peterkin will likely take snaps at quarterback, but either one will feed the ball to senior running back Ty'rese Hunt (1,309 yards, 17 TDs), who returns as the conference's top rusher. Hendersonville will also have Kalin Ensley (63 catches, 1,258 yards, 19 TDs) at its disposal, one of WNC's top returning athletes. Ensley will be used in many way on offense. North Henderson's strength looks to be in its offensive line behind seniors Jacob Allison, Curtis Matthews and Brock McKee. With the graduation of top running back and receiver Darren Lammons, sophomore Windell Flowers will carry the load in the backfield while Alberto Martinez (7 catches, 129 yards, 1TD) looks to have a breakout season. With the transfer of junior Nazaire Henderson to East Henderson, junior Jaret Jystad is the likely Week 1 starter at QB. Pick: Hendersonville by 21 West Henderson at Madison Last Year: West Henderson won 30-28 Notes: The Falcons hold a four-game win streak over the Patriots, but the last two contests have been decided by two points. Madison enters the season with a new coach, Kyle Hutchinson - previously an OC at Whiteville - and a young team looking to prove it can compete in the Western Highlands Conference this year. The Patriots have not had a winning season since 2012. They return only eight starters from last year, but will have senior quarterback Clark Gray - WNC's only 1,000-yard passer and rusher in last year. He'll face a West Henderson defense that was forced to replace top tackler Jasper Thomas, who transferred to Christ School in late July. The Falcons' offensive backfield will consist of three players, senior Jordan Geyer, junior Auden Brennan and sophomore Keyaris Cash, but coach Paul Whitaker will wait until the first snap to reveal his starter at quarterback. They'll face a Madison defense that is anchored by top returning tackler Colby Arnett, who will look to lead a young defensive core. Pick: West Henderson by 1 Andrews at Smoky Mountain Last Year: Smoky Mountain won 56-21 Notes: Last week the location of this game was changed to Smoky Mountain due to issues with Andrews' athletic facilities. So, for the second straight season, the Mustangs will host the Wildcats in a season opener. Week 1 will act as Smoky Mountain's home opener and the first game for head coach Rickey Brindley, who was hired in May after spending several years as an assistant coach at Pisgah. Brindley will put his offense in the hands of senior quarterback James Hinson - a former JV quarterback as a sophomore - who takes over for Nate Coffey. Hinson will have several targets, including Cody Lominac (44 catches, 826 yards) and speedy sophomore Dustin Stevens (36 catches, 612 yards). Smoky Mountain threw for nearly 250 yards in the win against Andrews last season and will look to air it out again. The Wildcats are starting fresh this year after producing one win in 2017. They return only five starters from that team. Coach James Phillips said he wants to change the perception that they are an "easy-win" team and a strong performance against Smoky Mountain would start to change the conversation. The Wildcats will lean returning running back and wideout Zach Sheppard on offense and leading tackler Landon White on defense. Pick: Smoky Mountain by 21
Brevard football coach Craig Pritchett (Photo: CITIZEN-TIMES PHOTO) Brevard at Mountain Heritage Last Year: Mountain Heritage won 30-7 Notes: Life without quarterback Trey Robinson begins at home against Brevard for Mountain Heritage as the Cougars begin what they hope will be another deep postseason run. Callin Randolph takes over under center for Mountain Heritage and will be joined in the backfield by running back Jake Autry. They'll face a Brevard defense that returns seven starters, including senior defensive end Kane Deshauteurs (69 tackles). The Cougars return only nine players from last year, but they'll still have a stout defense behind linebacker London Neill (134 tackles) and returning lineman of the year Zeb Virnelson. They'll face a Brevard offense that looked strong in the offseason behind returning quarterback Mitchell Johnson, who passed for 1,889 yards and 21 touchdowns in 2017. Johnson will target Coastal Carolina wide receiver commit Luke Ellenberger to try to stretch Mountain Heritage's defense. Senior Anthony Fields will also get the start at running back for the Blue Devils after rushing for 518 yards and six scores as a junior. Pick: Mountain Heritage by 6 Murphy at Pisgah Last Year: Murphy won 30-13 Notes: Pisgah enters the season with hopes for not only a conference title but a state championship run. A Week 1 test against Murphy is just what the doctor ordered. Last year, the Bulldogs dominated this matchup on their way to a three-way split title in the Smoky Mountain Conference while advancing one game shy of a 1AA state title game. They'll face a tougher Black Bears squad this year, which looks to be stacked with Division I talent, including N.C. State tight end commit Kam Walker. Sophomore Korey Griffith takes over at quarterback, while Tanner Wike makes the move to receiver. Eric Robinson (596 yards, 5 TDs) gets the start at running back. Pisgah also returns conference lineman of the year Terran Brown as well as standout defensive back Jon Mehaffey. Murphy's offensive strengths center around its running game and a stable of backs that includes Slade McTaggart (808 yards), KJ Allen (629 yards) and Devone Murray (653) yards. Last year's leading receiver, Micah Nelson, will get the start at quarterback for the Bulldogs and will be protected by senior lineman Hunter Shope, who looks to be a leader on both sides of the ball. This game may come down to who can limit turnovers and mistakes. Pick: Murphy by 3 Rosman at East Henderson Last Year: East Henderson won 35-28 Notes: Both teams enter this game with second-year head coaches looking for fresh starts after tough 2017 campaigns. East Henderson coach Justin Heatherly was forced to find a new quarterback during the summer after Chris Hemphill transferred to Asheville School and will use either North Henderson transfer Nasiah Henderson or last year's backup Garrett Atkinson as his Week 1 starter. New offensive coordinator Brock Pursley should give the Eagles offense a boost while they look to feed the ball to receiver Caleb Shipman (415 yards, 4 TDs). Senior Brenden Foushee will anchor the offensive and defensive line while seniors Korbitt Collins and Kenny Pridmore return as hard-hitting linebackers. The two combined for 141 tackles in 2017. Rosman coach Matt Stack knows his team can score points. The Tigers return eight players from that offense, including senior quarterback Luke Stewart (2,119 yards, 15 TDs, 15 INTs), running back Thomas Collins (1,070 yards, 4 TDs), Marcus Stamey (414 total yards), Hooper Thomas (223 receiving yards) and Samuel Chappell (757 receiving yards). They will however, have to significantly improve on the defensive side, and look to lean on senior linebacker Kayne Smith, who led the team with 8.5 sacks last year. Pick: Rosman by 1 Polk County at Chase Last Year: Polk County won 30-14 Notes: The Wolverines will open their 2018 campaign with a very winnable game against a Chase team that finished 1-10 in 2017 and begins this season with a new head coach. Former Crest defensive coordinator Cort Radford takes over a Chase program that is 8-36 in the last four years but returns 11 starters, including playmakers such as Kayshawn Woods and Keith Godfrey, to try to get this program going back in the right direction. The Trojans will face a Polk County team coming off an impressive 8-5 season that has 12 returning starters, including seven on offense. Avery Edwards - who took over the quarterback position late last season - returns under center, but the attention will go to senior running back Elijah Sutton, who looks to improve on his 1,293 yards from last season. Sutton rushed for 76 yards on nine carries and two scores in last year's win over Chase. The Trojans could struggle against Polk County's sizable defensive line, anchored by conference sack leader Bryson Seay and Luke Sellers Pick: Polk County by 10 Avery County at Ashe County Last Year: Avery County won 56-35 Notes: Ashe and Avery County combined for 91 points in last year's shootout, and 2018's game may be just as fun. While Ashe County returns 16 seniors from its 2017 team, it loses its best receiver, Grant Thompson, who left school with over 2,000 yards and 18 touchdowns. Ashe does, however, return senior quarterback Luke Hudler, who passed for over 3,000 yards in 2017. Hudler will have returning receivers Brandson Shepard (40 catches, 532 yards) and Corbin Coldiron (44 catches, 556 yards) at his disposal as well as running back Alex Lacroix. For Avery County, Week 1 will be fans' first chance to see new head coach Mac Bryan in action. Bryan has implemented a new spread formation on offense and tabbed senior quarterback Sam McCollum to run it. McCollum takes over the position for his older brother Van, who graduated in the spring. Look for WR/RB Tyree Jackson to have a big game on offense as well as running back Cole Singleton. Pick: Avery County by 3 Towns County at Hayesville Last Year: Towns County won 38-21 Notes: With 15 returning starters from last year's team, Hayesville looks to have its strongest season in a decade. A win over Towns County would be a huge lift to start the year for the Yellowjackets after a 17-point loss to the Indians in their 2017 opener. In last year's game, quarterback Dwain Cook passed for 249 yards, but Hayesville struggled to move the ball on the ground. The Yellowjackets will lean on junior running back Ethan Smith to help move the ball on the ground this year to slow down Towns County's offense. The Indians are coming off their program's first playoff appearance and return 10 starters on offense, including all five offensive linemen, veteran quarterback Trent Bradshaw and 6-foot-4 receiver Will Travis. Hayesville will need a good defensive performance to stop Towns County's triple option attack, leaning on its seven returning starters that includes lineman Adam Leek and Jesse Allison.

Rylee Anderson returns this season for Robbinsville, which travels to North Georgia on Friday. (Photo: Matt Burkhartt/mburkhartt@citize) Robbinsville at North Georgia Last Year: Robbinsville won 61-0 NotesC: Entering 2018 with only seven returning starters, Robbinsville is in desperate need of an early test before entering Smoky Mountain Conference play. It may not get it Week 1. The Black Knights rushed for 385 yards and five touchdowns against the Falcons last year and it's likely coach Dee Walsh will apply similar tactics in this meeting. WNC's leading rusher from last year, junior Rylee Anderson, should have a monster game. He rushed for 113 yards and two scores on seven carries in last year's win. Senior Austin Lovin will also get some carries, and new quarterback Landon Orr should have some chances to drop back and get comfortable in his new role. Pick: Robbinsville by 35 Christ School at Christian Academy of Knoxville Last Year: Christ School won 28-11 Notes: This game last year proved to be running back Sidney Gibbs' overture for the rest of the season. Then a junior, Gibbs rushed for 281 yards on 16 carries for four touchdowns on his way to a 2,000-yard season. This year, Knoxville (Tennessee) knows about Gibbs, but it will have plenty of other weapons to worry about. Christ School begins the season under first-year coach Tommy Langford, who sports an exciting offense behind junior quarterback Navy Shuler, receivers Keyvaun Cobb and Kaedin Robinson and Gibbs. Robinson - a Reynolds transfer - missed last season with an ACL tear but could quickly become one of the area's top threats. The Greenies' defense returns eight starters but also got stronger in the offseason with the incoming transfers of Franklin lineman Kade Chapman and West Henderson linebacker Jasper Thomas. Pick: Christ School by 14 R-S Central at McDowell Last Year: R-S Central won 20-14 Notes: McDowell struggled to find wins in 2017, finishing the season 2-9 and 1-6 in its new Northwestern 4A/3A Conference. But with 16 returning starters, the Titans look to be back on the attack under third-year coach Andy Morgan. Adam Randolph returns at quarterback and looks to be healthy after an injury-plagued junior season. Running back JC Olivo (832 yards, 166 carries) must have a big game for McDowell to earn a Week 1 win. He'll run behind a largely young offensive line that will have to prove itself early. After back-to-back losing seasons, R-S Central boasts a veteran team (15 starters back) led by senior quarterback Jayden Waddell (1,754 total yards and 15 touchdowns last year), an experienced offensive line and a strong defense (eight starters back).
