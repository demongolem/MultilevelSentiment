MUST HAVES Fantasy football tips: Five players you need for Game Week 2
The World Cup stars should be returning to teams and there were a few surprises from the opening weekend By Jack Kennedy 17th August 2018, 10:17 am Updated: 17th August 2018, 10:18 am The first week of the Premier League was all about mid-table sides powering your teams.
But Game Week 2 should see the gradual return of the World Cup stars who were rested for the opener.
Huddersfield face an ominous trip to already-in-form Man City, unfancied Southampton take on Everton and Crystal Palace meet Liverpool on Monday night in the juiciest fixture of the week. Game Week 2: five players you need to get in your team 1 Richarlison â€“ Everton 6
Who said Richarlison was heavily over-priced at Â£50m? Pretty much everyone.
But Marco Silva seemed to know better and the Brazilian began to repay his transfer fee with two goals against Watford on his debut.
This week Everton host Southampton which should be a comfortable three points for the Toffees and Richarlison could be in the goals again.
He scored twice at Goodison Park for Watford last season so could make it three goals in two games here tomorrow.
Richarlison picked up 12 points in GW1 and yet still only 5.9% of you have him in your team â€“ he's a steal at Â£2.5m too. 2 Sergio Aguero â€“ Man City PA:Press Association
It looks like Aguero is going to be Pep Guardiola's striker of choice for the visit of Huddersfield.
Chelsea thumped the Terriers 3-0 last weekend and City are a much more fearsome prospect.
Aguero seems to thrive on these games and he could be the perfrect man to finish of several of City's beautifully created chances.
Expect goals, goals and more goals.
Aguero's popularity has shot up this week with nearly 40% of managers opting for City's record scorer and it's obvious why. 3 Neil Etheridge â€“ Cardiff 6
Here's your wildcard for the weekend.
Cardiff may have lost to Bournemouth last weekend but Neil Warnock will have them drilled and fired up for their bow in front of the home fans this weekend.
Although the newly-promoted side lost Etheridge saved a penalty in that game and Cardiff will be a different beast at home.
Etheridge only costs Â£1.5 and 99.9% of you have overlooked him, but with Newcastle in a continued state of unrest, this could be a clean sheet for Cardiff.
Fortune favours the brave, remember that. 4 Jamie Vardy â€“ Leicester 6
If Claude Puel only has two games left to save his job he should turn to Jamie Vardy to sink Wolves this weekend.
Everyone is very excited about the champions of the Championship but the Premier League is where the big boys play and they won't be used to playing strikers of Vardy's quality every week.
The England man scored in injury time against Man United last weekend and he's been criminally under-selected at 6.2%.
The Foxes will look to feed him at every opportunity and Wolves could be in for a shock.
Vardy will add to his five-point haul from last weekend. 5 Yerry Mina â€“ Everto
