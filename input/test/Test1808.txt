will participate in Touch Taiwan 2018 at Taipei Nangang Exhibition Center from<br />August 29 to 31<br />to showcase world's<br />largest*<br />85-inch 8K4K bezel-less ALCD TV display, combining leading bezel-less, next generation HDR, 120Hz ultra high refresh rate, and quantum dot wide color gamut technologies to deliver exceptional image quality and appearance, setting the<br />b<br />ar for next generation image quality. Public information display solutions for transportation will also be demonstrated, featuring high resolution, high brightness, high contrast, low reflection, power-saving and high durability to meet stringent demands for quality and stability on transportation hubs such as airports and stations.<br />Ultra Large 8K4K LCD Displays Heading 8K4K Display Standard<br />With the coming of the era of ultra-high image quality TVs and business opportunities from<br />8K<br />resolution broadcast at<br />Tokyo<br />2020, AUO has devoted substantial R&amp;D efforts to proactively developing related technologies, including 8K4K (7680 x 4320) ultra high resolution, bezel-less, high dynamic range, ultra high refresh rate, quantum dot wide color gamut and curved design, leveraging the strengths from stacking core technologies to head the next generation imaging market.<br />AUO 85-inch 8K4K bezel-less ALCD TV display possesses several industry-leading strengths, including the proprietary use of<br />GOA<br />(gate on array) technology to become the first to have<br />produced*<br />all around bezel-less design for maximized viewing effect, creating the most lifelike and astounding viewing experience. The next-generation HDR technology incorporates 1200 nits peak brightness and ultra low reflectance to deliver enhanced true black and brightness, creating delicate and vivid images with<br />greater<br />image depth and captivating colors. The 120Hz ultra high refresh rate renders all images to stay smooth, bright and sharp, capturing high speed images and scenes with precision. Meanwhile, the quantum dot wide color gamut technology offers high color saturation of over NTSC 110%, capable of revealing images with rich colors and intricate details under all circumstances.<br />PID Solutions of High Quality and Durability for Transportation Purposes<br />AUO will showcase stretched, outdoors, dual-sided and extreme narrow bezel video wall public information displays (PID) for train station concourse, platforms, coaches, and outdoor and semi-outdoor venues that require long operating hours, providing passengers with real time travel information and advertisements.<br />Among the exhibits, the 37-inch and 42-inch stretched displays<br />can<br />be oriented in landscape or portrait modes. The special stretched ratio could easily fit in the spare space above passenger seats. The displays have passed the international standard for electronic equipment used on rolling stock for railway applications to ensure quality and endurance under harsh environments such as high temperature, humidity and vibration. Outdoor commercial signage such as 21.5, 32 and 65-inch displays feature high brightness, high durability, and high performance and stability. The displays are suitable for outdoor and semi-outdoor venues such as station platforms and bus stops. Under direct sunlight, the displays still offer clear and sharp images and<br />can<br />its<br />system solution to adjust brightness accordingly, saving power to attain optimal viewing performance.<br />AUO has successfully developed various industry-leading PID products for outdoor, retail and transportation purposes with its profound technological base and manufacturing capability. The Company also offers total solutions covering panels, full set system, software and after-sales service to meet demands from all kinds of venues.<br />The Display Innovation Taiwan Conference 2018 will be held concurrently with the exhibition.
