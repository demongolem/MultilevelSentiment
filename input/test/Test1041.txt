Polish bookie STS has announced a fresh deal IMG to "significantly extend" its offer of broadcast sporting events via its website and mobile app.
Under the terms of the new deal, which is to to run until the end of 2020, the firm is to enhance its offering by approximately 20 thousand sporting events, including streams of football, handball, volleyball, basketball, tennis and hockey, amongst others.
The service is available free to all adult users, and builds upon its current free broadcast service of over 2,000 sporting events each month.
All games can be followed on its sts.pl website and through the bookmakers app, while a selection of streams are also available throughout the country on stationary STS betting points.
Mateusz Juroszek, CEO at STS , commented: "We are observing a growing interest in live betting among the customers. For this reason, we are investing in the broadest possible offer of sporting-event broadcasts, in various disciplines from around the world.
"STS is the biggest legally operating bookmaker in Poland, and it has been systematically strengthening its leading position in this challenging local market.
"In fact, as much as 60% of the Polish market is covered by non-licensed operators, who do not pay taxes or comply with the strict Polish bookmaking law.
"Despite such an adverse competitive environment, we keep expanding our offer and offering new functionalities to our clients. Our aim is continued organic growth that will allow us to respond even better to our clients' needs."
This deal builds upon a deal held with Eleven Sports Network Group, which sees the provision of broadcasting space to Eleven, Eleven Sports and Eleven Extra in all STS owned venues.
Sts.pl broadcasts are available to all registered users, regardless of whether or not they are active players, with registration available for free to all adult users via its website. Shar
