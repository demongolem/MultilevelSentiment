The NFU has confirmed the appointment of its Legal Panel firms after an intensive six-month review, with fifteen of its original members set to continue to serve on the panel.
The Legal Panel, which was originally appointed in its current format in May 2008, is reviewed every three years. Each review considers the firms' legal services, fee structures and commitment to the organisation and its members, as well as feedback from NFU members and staff.
NFU director of finance and business services Ken Sutherland said: "The Legal Panel is a vital part of the services offered to NFU members, and following a rigorous and robust review process I am delighted to confirm that fifteen firms have been reappointed.
"The firms have built upon and strengthened their agricultural and rural teams, and their professionalism and depth of knowledge is second-to-none."
Chairman of the Legal Board Trevor Foss added: "The increase in regulation in the industry over the past few years has put the Legal Panel in high demand and we are committed to delivering a high quality service for all.
" The reappointments will serve to strengthen the bond between the NFU, the LAS and the panel solicitors, which together delivers tangible benefits for all NFU members and LAS subscribers." Get Our E-Newsletter - Weekly email news from Poultry New
