Broady (Baker) Beach in Quincy. Kimball Beach in Hingham and Bassings Beach in Cohasset have been closed to swimming by concerns over contamination.
The water at Broady Beach is clean, but it is posted as a precaution because of a recent spike in bacteria counts. The latest test results for Bassings Beach on water samples taken Aug. 6 show elevated bacteria levels.
Kimball Beach is over the limit in tests conducted Tuesday.
The other 57 South Shore beaches tested by state and local health officials are open.

High levels indicate the possible presence of disease-causing microbes that are present in sewage but are more difficult to detect. Bacterial colonies are filtered from 3 ounces of water and placed on a gel infused with nutrients and chemicals designed to promote growth. Left in an incubator, the single cells isolated on the filter grow explosively, forming colonies visible to the naked eye. After one day, the colonies are counted and if they exceed 104 colonies, the beach is closed to swimming. If the past five samples have a geometric mean exceeding 35 colonies, the beach must also be closed to swimming. Sign up for weekly e-mail
