Western Illinois Soccer Team Falls To Defeat In Springfield Posted: Leathernecks Fall To Defeat On Soccer Pitch SPRINGFIELD, Ill. (WGEM) -
Western Illinois dropped the season opener in a weather-shortened match at Missouri State in a 1-0 defeat to the Bears on Thursday (Aug. 16)."Lightning ended the game early unfortunately," Director of Soccer Dr. Eric Johnson said. "We had a decent first half and created two really good chances but did not finish them off. On their goal we let a winger cut inside and paid the price. Missouri State is a solid athletic team so it was a good test for us. We can build on our effort in this game and we are looking forward to the next one at Northern Illinois." The Leathernecks came out firing as Lauryn Peters ripped a shot on goal in the second minute of the game. Ines Palmiero Herrera recorded three saves before Kennady Orlick moved down the sideline and scored from five yards in the 45th minute to send the game to halftime with Missouri State up 1-0. Madeline Edwards opened the second half with a pair of shots but neither found the back of the net. Bianca Romay led a late surge in the 77th minute but missed a shot wide. During the 82nd minute, a storm cell moved through the area and the game entered a 30-minute delay before the match was called. The Leathernecks are off for a week before traveling to in-state foe Northern Illinois on Thursday (Aug. 23). The first kick is scheduled for 7 p.m. Can't Find Something? 513 Hampshire Quincy, IL 62301 Switchboard: (217) 228-660
