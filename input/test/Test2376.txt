With the need for a search for a new centre back ,Chelsea have turned their attention to Juventus ace Mattia Caldara as confirmed by our reporter.
However the Blues are said to have been put off by the Italian giants' valuation of fellow defender Daniele Rugani, forcing them to look at other targets based on the fact that the player was over priced.
Italian outlet Corriere dello Sport claims that Caldara, previously linked with Inter Milan this window, is now high on Chelsea's wishlist.
The report suggests that a Â£35m bid has been launched, which the West Londoners hope will be enough to persuade Juventus to part with the 24-year-old.
Caldara, who spent last season on loan with Atalanta BC, is the latest in a long line of Juve players to have been linked with Chelsea, including both Rugani and Gonzalo Higuain .
Higuain accepts Milan loan in respect of chelsea's demand.
following further talks last night and this morning crucial talk with the player , it is believed the former Napoli forward's fears have been allayed with a possible loan deal on the table.
Multiple report as confirmed by our reporter saying that the deal could even be confirmed later today â€“ along with the proposed exchange between Juve and Milan of defenders Mattia Caldara and Leonardo Bonucci.
However Sky Sport reports that Gonzalo Higuain has agreed to his proposed initial loan switch from Juventus to Milan.
The news is believed to be final confirmation that the transfer will go ahead, with everything else in place for the 30-year-old to move to San Siro.
Reports this morning in Italy suggested the two clubs had come to an agreement over the Argentine forward, with the player moving on an initial â‚¬18m loan and the Rossoneri having the option to sign him permanently for a further â‚¬36m next summer.
The only remaining potential stumbling block, it was claimed, was Higuain's reluctance to move on loan â€“ particularly without the obligation for Milan to sign him outright at a later date. By 90minsfootball in News Lucas Digne agree to move Everton.

El Mundo Deportivo now say an agreement of a fixed â‚¬20m plus variables has been reached for the transfer of the Frenchman.
The report continues that a delay in an announcement is only because both clubs are also discussing Colombian international Mina.
It must be noted that The Blaugrana paid Palmeiras â‚¬11.6m for the 23-year-old in January, but he has played just five times for the Spanish champions.
Mina netted three goals in the World Cup as he impressed with Colombia and he has been linked to a host of clubs this summer including Manchester United and Borussia Dortmund.
However Digne has played second fiddle to Jordi Alba in his time at the Blaugrana but has always produced reliable performances when called upon.
The former Paris Saint-Germain and Roma defender has made 47 first-team appearances across two seasons at Barca but only started eight league games last term.
Juventus and Bayern Munich had also been linked to the Frenchman earlier this year, with a summer departure from the club appearing increasingly likely.
Earlier this week, Everton boss Marco Silva admitted the club wanted to sign Digne, who moved to the Camp Nou in 2016 for a â‚¬16.5m deal. Jose Mourinho : These season transfer is frustrat ing.

"I would like to have two more players," Mourinho told Sports reporters after Man United were beaten 4-1 by Liverpool in the International Champions Cup.
"I think I am not going to have two. I think it's possible I am going to have one. It's possible.
"I gave a list to the club of five names a few months ago and I wait to see if it is possible to have one of these players.
"If it is possible it is possible, if it is not possible it is not possible. If it is possible, good, if it is not possible we keep fighting, working and believing in the players that we have."

According t our reporter Atletico Madrid have reached a deal with Italian giants Inter for the transfer of full-back Sime Vrsaljko and has been confimed by multiple reports.
The respected Croatian international has been heavily linked with the Nerazzurri while Atleti are expected to replace him with PSV Eindhoven defender Santiago Arias.
The 26-year-old has been continually linked with a move to Serie A in recent months but Napoli feel the offer is small and was rejected in January while Roma are also being linked.
Reports in Italy say Vrsaljko has made clear to Atleti that he wants to be allowed to make the move, as he'd like to return to Italy, while a deal in the region of â‚¬25m is said to have been struck.
The right-back extended his contract at Los Rojiblancos until June 2022 in February but the club are now set to sanction an exit after nearing a deal for Arias.

Crystal Palace bid rejected by West Ham for Cheikhou Kouyate bid'
According to our editor saying Crystal Palace have reportedly had an Â£11m bid for midfielder Cheikhou Kouyate turned down by West Ham United.
Kouyate is believed to be surplus to requirements at West Ham this summer, and Palace have been strongly linked with a move for the central midfielder in recent days.
Other report like Football London saying , Palace made an opening offer of Â£11m for the 28-year-old, but West Ham quickly rejected the bid as they want closer to Â£15m.
Kouyate, who has a contract with the Hammers until the summer of 2021, has scored 15 times in 147 appearances for West Ham since arriving from Anderlecht in 2014.
Palace have also been linked with a move for Kouyate's teammate Michail Antonio ahead of the 2018-19 campaign. Newcastle bid for South American Striker
According to multiple report as confirmed by our reporter saying ex-Rubin Kazan striker has a Â£16.5m release clause in his contract and Newcastle manager Rafa Benitez sees him as an ideal replacement for Aleksandar Mitrovic, who looks set for a permanent move to Fulham. Newcastle have stepped up their interest in Rondon, 28, after accepting an increased Fulham bid of Â£22million for Mitrovic, bringing that deal close to completion. The Serbian striker is now in London for a medical and could become a Cottagers player in the next few days The move for Rondon could involve Dwight Gayle going in the opposite direction â€“ either in a straight loan-swap or a player-plus-cash deal. Gayle was an unused substitute in Saturday night's 0-0 draw with Porto.
Aleksandar Mitrovic out of pre-season training.
According to our reporter monitoring the situation Newcastle striker Aleksandar Mitrovic has left the club's pre-season trip to Portugal after a transfer fee was agreed with Fulham .
It must be noted that the Cottagers have been wrangling with Newcastle over a price for the Serbian striker, who was a key figure in their promotion push after spending the second half of last season on loan at Craven Cottage. Mitrovic scored 12 goals in 17 games for Fulham after making just five appearances for Newcastle during the first half of the season, but the Magpies did not want to allow the 23-year-old to leave on the cheap. With no agreement in place, Toon boss Rafael Benitez took Mitrovic to Portugal, where Newcastle were playing a friendly against Porto on Saturday evening. But it is now understood the striker left the tour to head back to the United Kingdom after some common ground was reached and the move should go through in the coming days, Mitrovic joined Newcastle from Anderlecht in the summer of 2015 for 14.5million and has scored 17 goals in 72 appearances, but found his best form with the Cottagers last season David Luiz: I am pleased with Sarri.
Report from chelsea camp as confirmed by our I-reporter saying that Chelsea defender David Luiz is determined to remain at the Premier League club, where he is thriving following Maurizio Sarri's arrival.
It must be noted that David Luiz has no intention of leaving Chelsea as he enjoys life under new head coach Maurizio Sarri at Stamford Bridge.
Brazilian defender David Luiz was frozen out by former boss Antonio Conte last Premier League season but the veteran is back in the fold following Sarri's appointment.
Quoting luiz saying Sarri's tenure has opened with victory over Perth Glory in Australia and a penalty shoot-out win against Inter at the International Champions Cup â€“ David Luiz marshalling Chelsea's defence in both fixtures.
And the 31-year-old â€“ who re-joined Chelsea in 2016 having originally arrived in 2011 before leaving for Ligue 1 giants Paris Saint-Germain in 2014 â€“ is determined to remain in London.
"I came back to Chelsea to stay here," David Luiz said.
"When I took my decision to come back here from Paris it was to win the Premier League and to do something again with Chelsea, so I am very happy here."
"I love this philosophy," he said of Sarri. "We play high, with a lot of possession of the ball, in a technical way. He's trying to help us every single day to learn quickly his philosophy, to do our best for Chelsea.
"You guys know me â€” I like to be happy, to enjoy my life. We have the best job in the world. [Sarri] came with this idea as a human being, so I think if you're not happy to do your job it doesn't matter if you're a footballer or not. We have to be happy to do our best." Sheyi Ojo preparing loan move to Middlesbrough
Report from Middlesbrough claiming that Sheyi Ojo is keen on a loan move for Liverpool youngster Sheyi Ojo to enable him prepare for future challenges at ampfield.
It must be noted that the 21-year-old is currently away on the Reds' pre-season tour after spending last season on loan with Fulham.
Ojo played 24 times in all competitions for the Cottagers as they were promoted to the Premier League.
Boro want to strengthen their attacking options with Patrick Bamford set to join Leeds in a deal worth up to Â£10million.
And winger Ojo, as well as West Brom's Matt Phillips, is on their radar as reported by other sport reporters.
Ojo has previously had loan spells with Wigan and Wolves and is an England Under-21 international.
Roma looking into Cuadrado .
Roma reportedly asked for information about Juan Cuadrado as well as Suso, when they met agent Alessandro Lucci these week.
It was observed that the Giallorossi met with the agent to discuss Alessandro Florenzi's contract renewal, but it's thought they also asked for information about Milan's Spanish winger.
It must be noted that Sky Italia is reporting that the Lupi also discussed Juventus' Juan Cuadrado. Which is yet to be confirmed by our reporter.
Roma are looking for someone to play on the right wing after Barcelona hijacked their bid for Malcom. Brazilian Bernard's Close To Chelsea Switch.
With the coming of the new boss Chelsea are prepared to hold talks with Bernard's representatives over a potential move to Stamford Bridge this summer. According toâ€‚Andersinho Marques, as confirmed by our Team saying the Brazilian talent's agent is in London to discuss terms with the Blues over a potential transfer this summer.
However the 25-year-old sensation will be a low-risk signing as he is available for free but could turn out to be a shrewd asset for the West London outfit if they can lure him to Stamford Bridge in the coming weeks before the transfer window slams shut early next month.
It was also noted that Bernard has a lot of experience of playing at the highest level and has featured in the top tiers of both Italy and Ukraine football during his career. The Brazilian maestro has put in a number of magnificent displays for Shakhtar Donetsk over the past few years which is why it is a big surprise that the Ukrainian giants have decided to release him this year.
The 25-year-old had made 29 appearances for the Donetsk-based club last season, scoring 10 goals while providing four assists in all competitions. The Brazilian free agent is exactly the kind of talent who can flourish under the guidance of Maurizio Sarri if given enough opportunities to showcase his talents at Stamford Bridge. He will also be an ideal replacement for Willian if he departs the club this summer.
The West London giants couldn't manage to earn a top 4 spot last season so the Italian head coach needs some fresh talents in these final weeks of this ongoing window if he is serious about challenging for major silverware next season.
It must be noted that the potential acquisition of Bernard will undoubtedly improve Sarri's attacking options at the Bridge. Chelsea have some top-class wide men in their ranks such as Eden Hazard, Pedro, Willian and Victor Moses who are all vying for a place on the flanks in Sarri's first XI. The addition of Bernard will definitely bolster their team significantly and add more competition for places within the squad.
At 25, the Brazilian sensation still has his peak years ahead of him which the Blues could look to utilise in the next few campaigns. He is undoubtedly a decent acquisition, even more so, on a free transfer. Manchester United agree Â£67m for Chelsea Williams.
Based on previous report claiming the movement of Williams to united but Manchester United are now reportedly drawing closer to their fourth signing of the transfer window with reports suggesting that they have reached a financial agreement with Chelsea to sign Willian this summer for Â£67m
United Boss and tactician Jose Mourinho's side have already completed three summer signings in the form of Fred, Diogo Dalot and Lee Grant and there could now be on the cusp of a fourth with a deal for Willian close to completion.
Report as confirmed by us saying United are said to have agreed to pay a Â£67m fee for Willian shortly after Barcelona pulled out of the race and they are now in pole position to acquire his services before next month's transfer deadline.
Earlier this year, Mourinho did highlight that the club may not spending on the attacking department during the summer but the Portuguese tactician seems to have had a change of thought with the right-wing position, in particular, being a cause of concern.
Willian with his vast Premier League experience would certainly put a stop to the ongoing issue but there are concerns from a section of the fans that the Brazilian's arrival may hamper the gametime of the club's graduates.
Should a deal for Willian go through, the likes of Marcus Rashford, Jesse Lingard may have to fight for a role off the bench alongside Anthony Martial, though the latter has been heavily tipped to leave Old Trafford before next month's deadline.
Willian, who has two years remaining on his Â£110,000-a-week deal with Chelsea, enjoyed his best scoring season last term with 13 goals across all competitions. He managed to start in just over half of the club's league games amid his shrewd relationship with ex-boss Antonio Conte. Do you think N'Zonzi is worth â‚¬30m

According to il Romanista, the Lupi initially offered â‚¬23m, but are willing to go to â‚¬25m plus bonuses.
Sevilla are asking for â‚¬30m, but given that N'Zonzi wants to move to Rome it's thought a deal can be found.
However it was also confirmed that Arsenal was also considering the player as an ideal fit for them.
Bergomi: I like Asamoah the new signing.
It was noted that Inter legend Beppe Bergomi admits how surprised he was by new signing Kwadwo Asamoah.
However the Ghanaian signed on a free transfer from Juventus this month, having spent most of his time in Turin playing at left-back or left wing-back.
It was noted that Last night against Chelsea he played in midfield, and impressed the former Nerazzurro with his performance.
"He has great personality and individual technique as quoted by Beppe Bergomi.
"He knows how to protect the ball too and the play starts with him. He was a surprise even for me, in a role he hasn't played for some time now."
Ronaldo Vieir a now on Sampdoria Radar.

According to other reports as confimed by us saying the Blucerchiati have been following him for some time, and have been scouting him in pre-season.
Samp haven't yet made an official offer, but it's thought they will try to tempt Leeds with a bid in the coming weeks.

Once a fee is agreed, the newspaper expects the former Spain Under-21 international to pen a five-year contract with the Blucerchiati.
Obiang joined the Hammers from Samp in 2015 and went on to make 87 appearances for the Premier League club, scoring three goals and assisting two.
In the meantime, the Ligurians have officially brought in 18-year-old Mohamed Bahlouli, also a midfielder, from French side Olympique Lyonnais.
Juventus to offer Â£200m for Paul Pogba?.
According to our correspondance the Old lady is planning to raise up to Â£200m in a surprise attempt to re-sign Paul Pogba from Manchester United in the ongoing transfer window provided United are willing to sell.
It was noted that Pogba spent four seasons at the Bianconeri between 2012 and 2016 before returning to Old Trafford for a then-world-record fee of Â£89m.
Since then, Pogba has lacked the consistency to make him standout within the United ranks but he has nevertheless transformed into a key player from the starting lineup.
According to other report claiming that the Old Lady are planning to sanction the sales of Miralem Pjanic, Gonzalo Higuain, Daniele Rugani among others as they seek to recoup funds for a potential move for Pogba.
Pogba is presently on a holiday after winning the World Cup with France and reports suggest that the Bianconeri may need to pay a world-record fee of around Â£200m to have any chance of landing the midfielder.
United are currently short of senior midfielders in their ranks for pre-season after Jose Mourinho confirmed that Nemanja Matic would miss the start of the campaign following a surgery for an abdominal strain. Dortmund ready to sell Christian Pulisic ifâ€¦
According to our reporter Borussia Dortmund are ready to sell attacker Christian Pulisic provided the clubs are willing to meet their price condition.
However Real Madrid , Bayern Munich, Chelsea and Liverpool are said to be interested in the 19-year-old but will have to pay up to Â£65m to land the player.
According to the report, Bayern have for a long time been considered favourites to sign the USA international but Chelsea and Real have also made contact.
The price tag may looks steep for a young player like Pulisic who has not gotten to the top of the game but he could be great in the future and clubs will want a slice of that success.
With Franck RibÃ©ry and Arjen Robben gradually nearing the end of their careers, the Bundesliga champions have been linked with possible replacements for the duo.
Manchester United's Martial has also been linked with Bayern and the German giants have a great opportunity to sign him with the Red Devils unwilling to sell the Frenchman to a Premier League rival. Maurizio Sarri : I still want Morata .
According to Chelsea manager Maurizio Sarri who have refused to rule out Alvaro Morata's exit from Stamford Bridge before next month's transfer deadline.
The Spain international had an average debut season with the Blues with just 15 goals across all competitions and he has since been regularly tipped for a summer exit.
However Sarri has been questioned regarding Morata's future where he has admitted that he would only keep players, who are committed to the Blues.
"Morata? We want to keep our best players but not at all costs. We want to keep our top players but only if they want to be here. We want to keep improving," he told sport reporter
Morata has been linked with a possible Serie A return with AC Milan this summer but so far, the Rossoneri have yet to strike a transfer agreement with the Blues.
However the San Siro outfit are said to favour a loan deal or a cut-price move for the marksman but the Blues are reluctant to sell unless they recoup the entire Â£58m paid to Los Blancos last summer. Jose Mourinho confirms injury Matic.
According to Manchester United manager Jose Mourinho has confirmed that Nemanja Maticwill miss the start of the Premier League campaign after undergoing a surgery on an injury sustained at the World Cup.
It must be noted that the Serbia international joined his teammates in training earlier in the week despite carrying an abdominal injury and he has now undergone an operation to rectify the issue.
Speaking after United's 4-1 friendly defeat to Liverpool, Mourinho confirmed that the Serbian would certainly miss the start of the season as he steps up his recovery from the surgery.
Quoting United Boss saying "Matic came from the World Cup with an injury and the time he had to rest on holiday was not enough to resolve the problem,""He went to Philadelphia for a top specialist and he didn't leave the clinic. He immediately had surgery."

Aside from Matic, United are missing the services of a number of players who were present at the World Cup whilst Antonio Valencia, Chris Smalling and Luke Shawremain doubts for the curtain raiser
