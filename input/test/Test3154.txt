Normal text size Larger text size Very large text size Michael Cheika has promised that Australia's two influential playmakers, Bernard Foley and Kurtley Beale, won't take a backward step no matter how much traffic the All Blacks direct at them on Saturday evening.
If the Wallabies are to be any chance of going up 1-0 in the three-match series for the Bledisloe Cup, the Waratahs duo will need to be at their accurate and creative best from the first whistle.

Playing in 5 ... Don't Play While there has been plenty of speculation across the ditch whether Beauden Barrett is New Zealand's form No.10, there has been no such debate about Foley.
While there is hardly a queue of quality five-eighths banging down the door to usurp Foley, the Waratahs No.10's vast experience and familiarity with Beale is invaluable. The pair have played off one another for more than half a decade and know each other's idiosyncrasies.
Their interchangeable nature at first receiver is a huge benefit and will once again be utilised at ANZ Stadium in front of a sea of gold crossing their fingers that Foley and Beale can bring their A-game.

Attack: Michael Cheika with Wallabies playmakers Kurtley Beale and Bernard Foley.
Photo: AAP The pair have spoken about their motivation to help Australia break a 16-year Bledisloe Cup drought but the man who watches them closer than anyone, Cheika, has a feeling that they will be super sharp, particularly in defence.
"Beale is very, very motivated for this game, as is Foley," said Cheika on Alan Jones' 2GB radio program on Friday. "You won't see them take a backward step."
Beale has shown in the last 12 months he is a fearless defender. Sometimes his overeagerness results in the odd missed tackle but when it comes to one-on-one hits, there have been some memorable ones in that time. Not to forget some crucial strips in Wallabies territory that have got his team out of precarious, back-pedalling situations.
Cheika has complete faith that even if the All Blacks make a concerted effort to run over the top of Australia's 10 and 12, they will be ready.
Loading "They like to run at Foley and Beale because they think they're small blokes and they won't tackle," Cheika said. "But in those two guys you've got two very, very big hearts and they [New Zealand] will be coming at them."
As for Jones, a former Wallabies coach, he is one of Beale's biggest fans.
"This is as good as we've had; this young boy Kurtley Beale," Jones said on his show. "Magnificent athlete and I don't think he's ever been better than he is now."
That is some compliment given Beale is set to chalk up his 75th Test on the weekend, nine years after a debut off the bench in Cardiff.
Beale's opposite number, Ryan Crotty, has played exactly half the number of Tests the Australian has but underestimating his ability would be unwise.
Asked on Thursday about the threats Beale and Foley would pose in attack, Crotty said: "They're both very talented ballplayers. With Kurtleyyou've got to make sure you don't give him too much time and space. Any ballplayer with time and space will make you pay."
The Wallabies had a gentle jog around ANZ Stadium on Friday at their captain's run. They were jovial and exuberant and give the impression they are a team that believes they can bring down the mighty All Blacks against all odds.
It's time to play rugby. The stage is set and Cheika can't wait.
"I believe in our guys," Cheika said. "Over today, this last 24 hours, this is where the battle will be won.
