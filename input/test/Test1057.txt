Emily Ratajkowski's Instagram Is the Gift That Keeps on Giving Wardrobe malfunctions, new movie trailers, motorcycles â€” Emrata is never boring.

The trailer for Emily Ratajkowski's new film, Cruise , landed on the interwebs earlier this week.
The '80s-inspired movie marks Ratajkowski's return to the big screen after appearing in flicks like I Feel Pretty, In Darkness, and We Are Your Friends .
In the trailer, it looks like audiences can look forward to lots of leather, fast cars, and one very lucky ice cream cone. Suffice to say it could be, um, interesting.
However, that was not the most popular thing released this week by our favorite model/actress/feminist/designer.
Nope, that'd be the photo she posted of herself eating dinner somewhere in Italy with a barely digitally obscured wardrobe malfunction.
Never one for modesty, Ratajkowski posted the photo of her nonchalant nip slip at the dining table and neatly captioned it with the fork and knife emoji.  A post shared by Emily Ratajkowski (@emrata) on Aug 13, 2018 at 8:42pm PDT
Janet Jackson, eat your heart out.
Since Cruise doesn't hit theaters and on-demand channels until September 28, we've curated some more pics from EmRata's Instagram from this week and earlier to help tide you over.
