Celebrates Hand Hygiene Awareness Month by Offering Training, Support and Education to the Food Processing Industry Best Sanitizers, Inc. celebrates Hand Hygiene Awareness Month by offering hand hygiene training and guidance to the food manufacturing industry. PR Newswire NEVADA CITY, NEVADA CITY, /PRNewswire-PRWeb/ -- Best Sanitizers, Inc. celebrates August as Hand Hygiene Awareness Month . CDC (Center for Disease Control and Prevention) estimates that each year roughly 1 in 6 Americans (or 48 million people) get sick, 128,000 are hospitalized, and 3,000 die of foodborne diseases. Hand washing can make a difference in cross-contamination from food production workers. Contaminated hands can transfer pathogens to surfaces, utensils, ingredients, and finished food products. As part of Hand Hygiene Awareness Month, Best Sanitizers is offering food manufacturers free hand hygiene training, guidance and support through onsite training or through web-based presentations. Interested companies in the food manufacturing industry can learn more and schedule their training by calling Best Sanitizers at 888.225.3267. Food manufacturers require their production employees to wash their hands repeatedly throughout the day: before starting a shift, after using the restroom, after lunch, after breaks, and after touching anything that might carry pathogens. Best Sanitizers follows these CDC guidelines for proper hand washing technique: Thoroughly wet hands with clean, running water, apply an adequate amount of soap, rub palms and back of hands, rub thumbs and interlace fingers, rub fingertips into palm of opposite hand, rub wrists, rinse well with running water, dry hands thoroughly with a disposable paper towel. Best Sanitizers recommends using a quality hand soap like AlpetÂ® Q E2 Sanitizing Foam Soap to reduce pathogens. Alpet Q E2 Sanitizing Foam Soap is pH balanced and formulated with emollients to help keep employees' hands soft and healthy, even with repeated use. The goal of hand hygiene is to reduce the number of pathogens on the hands to the smallest number possible. Hand sanitizing after washing will further reduce the colony forming units (CFUs) on the hands, making it more difficult for germs to transfer on to surfaces, utensils, ingredients, and finished food products from contaminated hands. For maximum pathogen reduction, Best Sanitizers recommends using an effective hand sanitizer, such as AlpetÂ® E3 Plus Hand Sanitizer Spray . This additional layer of pathogen reduction can greatly reduce the risk of cross-contamination. Its 71% Ethanol formula is 99.9999% effective in killing 26 tested pathogens in 15 seconds, which is one of the highest LOG reductions in the industry. Alpet E3 Plus is formulated with emollients to keep hands soft and healthy, even with repeated use. As a spray, it goes on light and leaves hands feeling silky, not heavy and sticky. Best Sanitizers encourages food processors and food handlers to look at their own hand hygiene programs for any areas that can be improved. The new Food Safety Modernization Act (FSMA) ruling includes, "continual improvement" as an element food processors must incorporate into their food safety plans and adding sanitizing soap and hand sanitizer is a good way to meet this requirement. "Our goal is to promote and advance food safety throughout the industry," states Ryan Witt , Vice President of Sales and Marketing. "And, we want to provide food industry professionals with the tools and education they need to reduce cross-contamination from hands." Best Sanitizers, Inc. offers on-site hand hygiene trainings, demonstrations, and educational webinars for your facility, including food processing plants, nutraceutical facilities, and pharmaceutical processors. With a full line of quality AlpetÂ® hand soaps and hand sanitizers, Best Sanitizers can help food manufacturers choose the right products and maximize hand hygiene efforts with training and support designed specifically to meet their plant's needs.
