Most people reach a point when they get tired of sitting behind a desk â€” we have heard stories of men and women quitting their jobs and travelling the world. Former journalists Alisha Wadia and Friyan Driver did things a little differently. After planning and travelling to exotic locations â€” as part of their job at Lonely Planet India â€” they are now putting together other people's holidays. The duo, who left the travel publisher last December, run Handmade Journeys, a service that offers customised luxury holidays.
"It came together at the right time. Both of us had a goal of starting something and continuing to work in the travel sector," says Wadia, while Driver adds, "After close to a decade of planning trips â€” researching information about our destination, deciding what kind of story to pursue, and planning the itinerary accordingly â€” the experience came in handy."
Local and immersive
The process is simple: once a client approaches them, they have extensive conversations. Wadia explains this is important because, "beyond their destination, budget and number of days, we find out what their interests are and what kind of pace they'd like their holiday to have. We then tailor an itinerary with our recommendations, but the final decision is theirs". They take care of bookings and flights, and are planning to take up the visa process as well shortly. Their USP: combined, extensive knowledge of places that probably do not feature on a mainstream travel company's offering. Almost all their trips feature personal discoveries.
Some of the more interesting trips they have curated include a picnic in the Sacred Valley (just over 50 km from Machu Picchu in Peru), where a Cusco lady cooked a traditional meal for a couple after their trek, served in a private setting. The spread included a local herbal tea (coca) that helps combat altitude sickness, baked eggplant, staples like ceviche, and wine. At Galapagos Islands â€” where cruises are commonly the easiest way to visit â€” they organised an adventure sports itinerary that included snorkelling with marine iguanas and giant turtles.
Made to taste
Food seems to be popular. "One of our upcoming clients is going to Osaka, and we're putting together a food trail. Earlier, we did a similar one in London for a client who is particular about her bootcamp and dietary habits even while travelling. We recommended The Gate Restaurant, Granger & Co, Wild Food Cafe and Protein Haus. We also did a sushi and whiskey trail in Tokyo," Driver shares.
While previous experiences help them put together under-the-radar itineraries, both women say that it is an ongoing process to make sure their millennial audience gets the kind of experiences they are looking for. "It's endless hours of research, and trying to find the best possible local suppliers and hotels," says Wadia. They also keep themselves updated. "Besides travelling and collecting information on ground through recces, we keep up with trade news, and filter what we think we'd like to curate," Driver adds.
Personal picks
While they design holidays for the deep-pocketed, adventurous traveller, the Mumbai-based partners have vastly different preferences when it comes to their jaunts. Wadia prefers roadtrips and the outdoors. "I love the jungles, especially in India, like Kabini, Pench and Kanha. I became a certified diver in Maldives, so that's close to my heart. The most memorable part of that trip was staying on a river boat â€” the marine wildlife was stunning." As for culture and architecture, she picks the south of France.
Driver, on the other hand, is more into city holidays, describing herself as a "beach person who likes a bit of adventure, like snorkelling or kayaking". "Owing to its location between North Africa and Sicily (Italy), Malta is a beautiful combination of two very different cultures. This is evident in its architecture. Although it's just the size of Mumbai, there is a lot to offer, like an interesting cuisine that includes the famous Gozitan Rabbit, endless seafood platters and a prickly pear liqueur. Valletta has tonnes of World War lore for history buffs, while the sister island of Gozo has gorgeous beaches," she says.
Although they have worked together for so many years, the two have surprisingly not travelled together. But White Desert Luxury Glamping in Antarctica is on their bucket list.

Three to visit
With Europe, South East Asia, Australia and New Zealand being covered extensively, travellers are looking for more exotic, unknown destinations, say Driver and Wadia.
South America: "The most popular countries would be Peru, Brazil and Argentina, and would require at least 18 to 20 days. We recommend taking the Belmond Hiram Bingham Train through the Peruvian Andes, staying at the Nat Geo Mashpi Lodge in the Ecuadorian Cloud Forest, and a cruise through the Galapagos Islands. In Argentina, trek the glacier at Perito Moreno, and stay at the Awasi Iguasu Hotel. In Brazil, visit the Bahia beaches." â‚¹10 to â‚¹12 lakh per head*.
Capri: "A trip to Capri and Positano on the Amalfi Coast for a week should help you take in the sights. Take a full day cruise around the coast on a private yacht, indulge in luxury, artisanal shopping, and attend local cooking classes. Stay at Hotel Punta Tragara in Capri and Le Sirenuse in Positano." â‚¹5 lakh per head*.
Africa: "We pick a luxury safari at Serengeti, Zanzibar's beaches and snorkelling with whale sharks at Mafia Island as our favourite experiences. Stay on a private island off the Zanzibar coast, and for the safari, head to the privately-owned MalaMala Game Reserve in Kenya. Set aside two weeks for an immersive experience." â‚¹10 lakh per head*.
