 Commonwealth's Attorney Green,
A dog was allegedly abused by a mobile groomer in a horrific case of animal cruelty. The dog reportedly suffered injuries so severe that the poor animal could have died. We demand justice for this innocent dog.
James City County police charged Kimberly Martin with animal cruelty after she allegedly abused a dog during a mobile grooming session. Per a resident, his 13-year-old Pekinese-poodle mix became short of breath following a grooming session with GroomZ. The resident rushed his dog to an emergency veterinarian when the animal's tongue turned purple. Per the veterinarian, the dog suffered broken ribs, bruising, a hemorrhage in one eye, and a swollen larynx. The dog received treatment and survived. Martin will face her charges at a later date.
If convicted, this groomer is a danger to animals and must not be allowed to work with them ever again. We demand that you seek the maximum penalty in this case.
Sincerely
