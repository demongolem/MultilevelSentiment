2 cited for alleged alligator violations in Louisiana
BATON ROUGE, La. (AP) â€” Two men have been cited for alleged alligator violations in Louisiana.
Enforcement agents for the state Department of Wildlife and Fisheries say 59-year-old Barry Pedigo, of Pensacola, Florida, and 28-year-old Logan Madere, of Westwego, Louisiana, were cited for possessing an alligator during a closed season.
Agents received information about an alligator being illegally harvested at Burns Point Park in St. Mary Parish. After investigating, agents learned that Pedigo captured an alligator by hand. Pedigo was bit multiple times and was treated at Lafayette General Hospital.
Madere then killed the alligator, which was 4-feet-8 inches (1.2 meters) long.
Illegally harvesting an alligator brings a $400 to $950 fine and up to 120 days in jail. The men may also face civil restitution totaling about $375 for the replacement value of the alligator.
BLACK LIVES MATTER SUED
Court: Dismissal of cop's Black Lives Matter lawsuit is just
(Information from: The Advocate, http://theadvocate.com)
BATON ROUGE, La. (AP) â€” A federal appeals court says a Louisiana court rightly dismissed a deputy's lawsuit accusing Black Lives Matter and several leaders of inciting violence that led to a deadly 2016 attack on law enforcement officers.
The Advocate reports a three-judge panel of the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in New Orleans unanimously supported the lower court's ruling Wednesday. A judge found last year that the lawsuit failed to state a plausible claim for relief.
The suit doesn't name the officer but its description of the plaintiff matches East Baton Rouge Parish Sheriff's Deputy Nicholas Tullier, who was critically wounded by 29-year-old Gavin Long. Long killed three law enforcement officers and was later gunned down by authorities.
The attack occurred less than two weeks after a white Baton Rouge officer killed 37-year-old black man Alton Sterling during a struggle.

Judge orders distant jurors for retrial in burning case
(Information from: The Commercial Dispatch, http://www.cdispatch.com)
STARKVILLE, Miss. (AP) â€” Jurors in the retrial of a man charged with killing a woman by setting her on fire will come from northeast Mississippi.
The Commercial Dispatch reports Panola County Circuit Judge Gerald Chatham is ordering 300 potential jurors called in Oktibbeha (awk-TIHB'-ee-hah) County.
Jurors would travel to Panola County once selected, where the retrial of Quinton Tellis is supposed to begin Sept. 24. Out-of-county jurors are being used because of wide publicity.
Tellis has pleaded not guilty to capital murder in the death of Jessica Chambers. Jurors from southwest Mississippi's Pike County couldn't reach a verdict in October.
Prosecutors say Tellis torched Chambers and her car in 2014. Firefighters found a smoldering Chambers walking near the car.
Tellis is also charged with murder in a 2016 stabbing in Monroe, Louisiana.

ELMER'S ISLAND AIRSTRIP
Airstrip planned at Louisiana wildlife refuge
GRAND ISLE, La. (AP) â€” Louisiana and a local government plan to open an airstrip on a state wildlife refuge near the state's only inhabited barrier island.
The Department of Wildlife and Fisheries and Grand Isle Independent Levee District signed an agreement Thursday for the levee district to operate Grand Isle Airport at Elmer's Island.
There used to be a sand airstrip on the 2Â½-mile-long (4-kilometers) sandy spit.
A news release says Thursday's agreement calls for developing an aircraft hangar, an aircraft ramp and tie down, fuel tanks, fueling area and an area for a terminal building.
Gov. John Bel Edwards says it will increase public use and recreation at the refuge.
Department Secretary Jack Montoucet says it also will provide his workers easier access to the state fisheries research lab and oyster hatchery on Grand Isle.
LOUISIANA ROADS-GUN DISPUTE
Louisiana bars banks from $600M deal because of gun policies
BATON ROUGE, La. (AP) â€” Louisiana officials have blocked two of the nation's largest banks from involvement in a $600 million road financing plan because they have policies restricting gun sales by their commercial customers.
In a narrow 7-6 vote, the State Bond Commission refused to allow Citigroup and Bank of America to participate in the interstate highway financing work.
The effort to ban the banking giants from the road deal was led by Attorney General Jeff Landry and Treasurer John Schroder and opposed by Gov. John Bel Edwards' administration.
Those pushing to exclude Bank of America and Citigroup from the financial work said by enacting firearm restriction policies for their corporate customers, the banks were violating Second Amendment rights.
Opponents said the move exceeded the commission's authority and would force Louisiana into costly litigation.
AP-US-MAYORAL-CANDIDATE-THREATENED
Police, FBI investigate threat against mayoral candidate
SHREVEPORT, La. (AP) â€” Federal and state authorities are investigating after a black mayoral candidate in Shreveport, Louisiana, said he was threatened with lynching if he didn't drop out of the race.
Louisiana State Police trooper Glenn Younger told the Shreveport Times on Thursday an investigation was opened after Caddo Parish Commissioner Steven Jackson said he received the anonymous threat.
At a news conference, Jackson said an envelope containing the threat inside was left at his home. He showed a piece of paper depicting his face on top of a head in a noose with the word "Rope" below.
Under the image, Jackson was called a racial slur and urged to stop trying to remove a Confederate monument from the grounds of a local courthouse.
Shreveport is about 330 miles northwest of New Orleans.
FLOODING-POWER COSTS
Utility wants lost revenue from 2016 Louisiana flooding
(Information from: The Advocate, http://theadvocate.com)
BATON ROUGE, La. (AP) â€” A major electric utility wants to recover nearly $6 million in revenue lost in the flooding in Louisiana in 2016.
The Advocate of Baton Rouge reported that Entergy has asked Louisiana regulators to allow it to impose a surcharge on the bills of nearly 468,000 customers in 20 parishes even if they never missed a payment.
The surcharge would recover the amounts not collected because of state orders to not shut off the lights or assess late fees on people flooded out of their homes.
More than 20 inches of rain fell over two days starting Aug. 12, 2016. Several rivers and bayous backed water into about 109,000 homes and 6,000 businesses.
The Public Service Commission prevented utilities from disconnecting service for nonpayment because of the flooding.
