intu Milton Keynes has launched a competition to 'bring your bug to life', just like the ones in the Big Bugs on Tour exhibition .
The regional shopping centre is inviting children aged between six and twelve to design their own bug â€“ inspired by the centre's month-long Big Bugs on Tour exhibition, which sees twelve giant insects placed on the mall until 28th August.
How you bring your bug to life is up to youâ€¦ whether it's a colourful drawing, or an egg box and empty washing-up bottle masterpiece, intu Milton Keynes would be delighted to receive it.
Judges are looking for the weird and the wonderful, as well as the bright and the beautiful. However, each entry must be anatomically correct for an insect with three clearly defined parts â€“ a head, thorax and abdomen.
The judges' favourite entry will be made into a 30cm model sized bug by our professional model makers!
"Big bugs on tour has been so well received in Milton Keynes and has attracted thousands of people to the centre from across the region," said Kirsty McGiff, marketing manager at intu Milton Keynes.
She adds: "We hope children will have been inspired by the tour and will enter our competition to design their own imaginary bug, which, if successful, could be created into a lifelike scale model for them to keep."
How to enter:
Email your design to csmiltonkeynes@intu.co.uk or hand it to the customer information desk (next to Debenhams) with your name, contact number and email address. Entries must be received by Monday 3rd September at 6pm.
About Big bugs on tour
New research has revealed that being closer to nature makes you 67% happier, but one in six children (16%) have not seen a single bug in six months.
The study marked the launch of the Big Bugs on Tour exhibition at intu Milton Keynes, which brings adults and children face-to-face with twelve giant British bugs in an effort to reconnect people with nature and make them happier.
The initiative by intu is backed by naturalist Chris Packham and features twelve supersized, indigenous bugs including the honeybee, ladybird, hornet, swallowtail butterfly and the nut weevil. It launched at intu Milton Keynes on Tuesday 31st July and will be on display until the end of August, before going on tour across other intu shopping centres nationwide
