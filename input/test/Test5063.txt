TBMC is piloting a new buy-to-let refurbishment product with Precise Mortgages.
The product includes initial bridging finance up to 75% LTV with rates from 0.49% per month, followed by a guaranteed exit onto a buy-to-let mortgage up to 80% LTV with rates from 2.89%.
Jane Simpson, managing director at TBMC, said: "Launching a new refurbishment product with Precise Mortgages is fantastic news for the buy-to-let mortgage market as this niche area has been woefully underserved in recent years, so it will really plug a gap.
"The product offers an excellent opportunity for buy-to-let investors, especially those who are looking to carry out works to meet minimum EPC ratings; purchase at auction and carry out light refurbishments before letting; make improvements to maximise rental yields; or purchase properties under valuation.
"We are expecting this to generate a lot of interest over the coming months and it should provide additional revenues for intermediaries in the buy-to-let market.
