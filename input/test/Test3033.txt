A Pixel 3 XL has been spotted in Toronto, which probably means there are a lot more out there. The Pixel 3 XL launch is not going to be an easy one, and by this point, it might be safe to assume that Google is waiting to just get it over with. The adoption of a notch for the upcoming generation of Pixel phones was bad enough, but the implementation of the biggest one yet is what pushed a lot of people over the edge of what they can accept. In fact, Android and Pixel fans will have a hard time accepting or using the XL version, and it's quite likely that the regular Google Pixel 3 with the smaller screen and no notch will be much better received. Close to launch In theory, the new line of Pixel devices will be released on October 4 , so we're not all that far away from the event. Even so, it looks like the Pixel 3 XL is already being used by some people, most likely a Google employee or a person of influence. According to a photo posted by MobileSyrup , someone snapped a picture of a Pixel 3 XL in the wild, being used in Toronto, Canada. From the looks of it, the photo is real, and it matches closely with the leaks that were released until now. The dual cameras in the notch give it away. While it's not entirely certain that it's a legitimate image, one thing is true; it's not a flattering one. It underlines the giant notch and it would be a really bad attempt at publicity. Interestingly enough, most people don't actually talk about the fact that it might be fake, but about the notch and the chin at the bottom. At this point, we can only hope that the cameras in the front and other features will compensate for the terrible design choice. # Pixel 3 XL # Google # Android # Notch # Google Pixel hot right no
