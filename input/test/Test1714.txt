Kauai and Niihau are under a hurricane watch, meaning hurricane conditions are possible and that winds of at least 39 mph are anticipated in the comings days.<br />Why is Hurricane Lane so rare?<br />The Central Pacific gets few hurricanes and tropical storms; the Atlantic or Eastern Pacific usually see many more named storms.<br />A car is partially submerged in water from Hurricane Lane rainfall on the Big Island on Thursday.<br />Hawaii is a small target in a vast ocean, and isn't often threatened.

"I'm hoping and all us here are praying the storm dissipates and disappears, but from all indications we are going to have heavy flooding and high winds no matter where Lane decides to go."<br />Authorities are asking people to seek shelter before it's too late or to stay in their homes if they believe those structures can withstand hurricane winds or storm surge.<br />Many others are leaving. Long lines were seen at airports in Honolulu as hundreds of people tried to catch flights out of the islands before the storm comes closer.<br />The 15 airports throughout the state will remain open as long they don't suffer damage to their infrastructure or the debris "makes flight operations unsafe," the Hawaii Department of Transportation said in a statement.<br />Rain, rain, and more rain!
