This time they've got the top spot all to themselves.<br />"It's not sunk in, it's such a big thing," says bassist Pete Wentz.<br />"I remember when we'd play there and be like, 'There goes Trent Reznor from Nine Inch Nails - he's headlining Reading and Leeds'."<br />So how do work your way up the bill and survive years at the festival? Here are Pete's tips.<br />Be Mr Nice Guy backstage<br />Image caption<br />Pete Wentz is very familiar with Reading and Leeds by now<br />Since first appearing at the festival in 2006, Fall Out Boy have never played anywhere but the main stage.<br />Pete claims there's a simple secret to that longevity.<br />"Being nice goes a really long way.<br />"When they're picking between two artists, they're going to pick the one that wasn't super difficult to work with. That's just so important."<br />It's not always your crowd<br />Image caption<br />The twin festivals have a diverse line-up<br />Pete also says one of the main things to keep in mind is that not everyone is there to see you.<br />"You're probably playing to a bunch of people that aren't hardcore fans... it's your chance to earn a crowd.<br />"You have to treat that a little differently to your own show."<br />Mix with the other bands<br />Image caption<br />Fall Out Boy used to tour with Skrillex's old band before he went solo<br />This year's line-up also includes Panic at the Disco.<br />They're "festival buddies" with Fall Out Boy but Pete says Reading and Leeds is a great chance to mingle with bands from across the line-up.<br />"Travis Scott's playing on our day, it would be cool to meet up with him," Pete says.<br />Image caption<br />Kendrick Lamar and Kings of Leon are the other headliners this year<br />Smaller bands should keep an eye out for Pete and co standing at the side of the stage during their sets because apparently the band is "pretty easy going".<br />"There's a lot of up-and-coming bands that will end up being massive and you get to check them out and hang out before everyone else does so I recommend doing that.<br />"If you want to hang out, we're down to hang out."<br />Prepare for the weather<br />Image caption<br />Flames are not forecast for this weekend, but we wouldn't rule it out<br />The forecast for this year's festival looks pretty mixed but Pete suggests sunblock is a must for any bands playing during the day, and of course don't forget boots because "that place gets pretty muddy".<br />"Oh, and you can never have enough wet wipes!" he adds.<br />"Wet wipes are your friend at a festival."<br />Follow Newsbeat on<br /
