,<br />Aug. 23, 2018<br />/PRNewswire/ -- As the Hawaiian Islands brace for Hurricane Lane, a category 4 hurricane that could potentially impact<br />Hawaii<br />between Thursday and Friday, the American Diabetes AssociationÂ® and its partners are preparing to ensure that people living with diabetes, especially those who depend upon insulin, are fully supported. The Diabetes Disaster Response Coalition (DDRC), comprised of the nation's leading diabetes care and research organizations, is urging all people with diabetes and their loved ones in<br />Hawaii<br />to prepare for Hurricane Lane by putting together a diabetes kit and making a plan to stay healthy and safe during the storm and in its aftermath.<br />The DDRC has created a<br />Patient Preparedness Plan<br />for people living with diabetes as they face unique challenges during times of disaster. Major storms may knock out electricity for hours, days, or longer, making it difficult to refrigerate or store life-saving insulin. Medication and diabetes supplies may be lost, damaged, or individuals may have run out of medication or vital diabetes supplies. There may be not enough drinking water and healthy food may be difficult to find.<br />&quot;When life is in a crisis mode, diabetes adds even more obstacles,&quot; says<br />Kelly Mueller<br />, Vice President of Business Integration for Programs and Products for the American Diabetes Association and Co-Chair of the DDRC. &quot;We know securing medication can be a challenge. Our goal as a Coalition is to ensure that people with diabetes have swift and adequate access to healthcare, information and supplies.&quot;<br />DDRC's Patient Preparedness Plan also includes a checklist of supplies, information and guidelines to best prepare a person with diabetes in the case of an emergency or natural disaster. The Patient Preparedness Plan and additional information and resources can be found at<br />diabetes.org/hurricanerelief<br />.<br />&quot;We encourage all health care providers to reach out to their patients with diabetes and urge them to download this plan and put it into action prior to the storm affecting the area,&quot; says<br />Carol Atkinson<br />, Director of Insulin for Life<br />USA<br />and Co-Chair of the DDRC.<br />In addition, two phone lines are available for individuals in need of assistance:<br />1-800-DIABETES for individuals with diabetes care needs; and<br />1-314-INSULIN for physicians and health care providers to get connected to diabetes supplies.<br />ADA's Center for Information, 1-800-DIABETES, is open from<br />8:30 a.m. ET to 8:00 p.m. ET<br />(<br />7:30 a.m. to 7:00 p.m. CT<br />), Monday through Friday.<br />About the Diabetes Disaster Response Coalition<br />The Diabetes Disaster Response Coalition (DDRC) formed in 2017 in response to a succession of devastating Atlantic hurricanes that impacted the mainland U.S. and territories.
