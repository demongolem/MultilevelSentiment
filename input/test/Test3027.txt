Usain Bolt arrives in Australia on Saturday as simply one of the lads. He's an ultra-famous nobody that wants a contract in the A-League. He will live and train on the Central Coast, as per the team rules. The fastest hamstrings the world has seen will be in the hands of the club physio.
World is watching: Bolt has trained with German powerhouse Borussia Dortmund, and will arrive in Sydney on Saturday for a stint with the Central Coast Mariners.

And then they are off. Easy as that.
Since the deal was completed to have Bolt trial for a contract over coming months, Mielekamp has been a busy man. Lampooned by some for orchestrating what many viewed as a publicity stunt around the eight-time Olympic gold medallist, now Mielekamp is preparing to host the sprint king in a region that is collectively shaking in anticipation of his arrival.

Playing in 5 ... Don't Play "No, to be honest, I don't think it will all sink in until after it's all happened. At the moment you're so busy and focused on what's next. There's no point being overawed, you just have to get the job done," Mielekamp said.
"I'm very confident that we've prepared from a commercial perspective. But for us, our focus is him as an athlete. He will get the best of care and we have to make sure we have our program in place, GPS tracking and medicals and all of that. But it's looking good."
Bolt will have no special treatment as he tries to impress Mariners coach Mike Mulvey, who faces one of the stranger challenges of his managerial career as he tries to decipher whether Bolt has any worth as a player.
Mielekamp said Bolt would not disrupt the regular training program and much of that insistence came from the sprint king and his management.
Loading "He has entrusted himself to the club. We've spoken to him from the outset about the way we like to develop players and how he will be looked after football-wise.
"He will be treated as every other player would, by the same staff and the same team and getting on the same program. He really bought into that."
Bolt has associations with the best sports doctors in the planet but will leave his training and high-performance needs in the hands of the Mariners, who have already made meticulous plans for care.
"Our head of medical, Andrew Young, has been brilliant in driving all of this. He has liaised with the doctor in Germany and with the guys that Usain has been working with. But as of the moment he lands, he will be in the hands of our strength and conditioning teams."
And there will be no daily commuting to and from Sydney. That rule was clear from the outset.
"It's the same for all of our players. It's a team rule that all of our players stay on the Central Coast. We have a couple of accommodation options available for him."
The Mariners are suddenly a club being mentioned in all corners of the football globe. That was undoubtedly part of the appeal in luring Bolt to the team. But Mielekamp said the marketing appeal of the move was balanced by the genuine ambitions of Bolt in a new sport.
"We've really made sure we focus on the athlete first. The sport does the talking. The whole journey here, the continual driver, has been Usain and his own belief and drive and desire for this to happen.
"It's hard not to buy into all of that. It is exciting. But the balance starts with looking after him as a footballer."
Bolt will undergo medicals and then train with the team for the first time on Tuesday. Among the teenaged hopefuls will be a man that stopped the sporting world on a dime in 2008 as he won the 100m in Beijing, celebrating 20m before the finish line, in world record time.
"On one hand, I'm sure some of the players will be in awe. On the other hand, I'm sure some of the players will be feeling like he's the rookie in the side. There's a really interesting paradox there. Athletes love hearing from other athletes. Everyone will have a chance to listen and learn.
"But wherever you turn there is a young kid doing the Bolt pose, or an old footballer thinking he could make a fantastic winger. It's truly a global sports story. Nobody knows exactly how this will play out. It's going to unfold before our eyes.
