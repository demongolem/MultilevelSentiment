Precise condition assessments produce correct decisions
In order to make the right decisions in terms of maintenance and investment, one needs precise knowledge of the condition of their transformers. Maschinenfabrik Reinhausen (MR) offers a comprehensive test portfolio for transformers. Thanks to decades of experience, clients receive a well-founded interpretation of measured values along with clear, practical recommendations for action. The company provides the entire measurement portfolio and corresponding services for power transformers from a single source. Oil diagnostics and electrical tests are key areas of this service. Oil diagnostics are a fast, easy and inexpensive option for early detection of abnormalities developing in a transformer or on-load tap-changer. Suitable electrical measurements can be used to identify abnormalities and introduce appropriate countermeasures. In addition to oil analyses and electrical tests, the company also provides a detailed visual inspection and infrared thermography.
