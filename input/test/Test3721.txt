House of Fraser has cancelled all online orders, and is refunding thousands of its customers, who have not received their goods.
It comes after a payment dispute with its warehouse operator XPO Logistics, which stopped processing orders last week.
The department store announced its decision via its official Twitter account.
The post says: "Due to delays with delivering online orders, we have taken the decision to cancel and refund all orders that have not already been sent to customers.
"All customers affected will receive an email in the next couple of days.
"Please accept our apologies for any inconvenience caused."
A swarm of angry shoppers have taken to Twitter to express their disappointment.
@UdnyQuine said: "I received an email apologising for CONVENIENCE caused by cancelling an order for 2 thirds of my husband's suit. This was for our holidays! I don't have time to go back to Edinburgh with the trousers which are now totally useless! What do you suggest I do!"
Meanwhile @gerrydoc7 posted: "Absolutely disgraceful. Ordered a Â£90 purse last Thursday. Yes a week ago for my daughters birthday. Not 1 email concerning delivery or info and now order cancelled and you say email in a few days!!! Get my money back ASAP"
And @lettielou05 commented: "My son's holiday clothes, thanks."
The high street chain has also told its customers that gift cards and vouchers will no longer be accepted, in store or online.
At this stage, it is not yet clear when - or even if - refunds will be issued.
House of Fraser has released a statement on its Facebook page, reading: "We have taken the decision to cancel and refund all orders that have not already been sent to customers," the department store said on Facebook.
"We didn't take this decision lightly, but since we cannot give our customers clear assurances of when their orders will be delivered, we believe cancellation is the best option.
"All customers affected will receive an email about the cancellation and refund in the next couple of days.
"Please accept our apologies for any inconvenience caused and thank you from everyone at House of Fraser for your patience at this time."
House of Fraser - which was bought out of administration by Mike Ashley's Sports Direct last week - took down its website on Wednesday (August 15).
The billionaire retail tycoon has outlined his plans to make House of Fraser the 'Harrods of the high street', and has also vowed to keep 80 per cent of the stores open.
His announcement comes after the department store said it was to close 31 of its 59 shops, affecting 6,000 jobs.
