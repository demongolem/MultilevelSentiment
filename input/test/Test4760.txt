A cat from Japan charmed Twitter users after it flattened one side of its face from being too much of a lazy, sleepy feline.
Belonging to Twitter user "@on_nen," the cat answers to the name Kojiro. Like most cats, Kojiro likes to laze about while tasking its human slaves to feeding and grooming duties.
However, on July 21, Kojiro's owner shared a snapshot of the cat getting startled from one of its naps. As Kojiro looked at the camera with lazy eyes, one side of its face had been flattened out from prolonged contact with its sleeping mat. ADVERTISEMENT
Twitter users found this image charming enough that Kojiro's woke-up-like-this photo has been retweeted over 12,000 times and liked by over 28,000 people as of this writing. Image: Twitter/@on_nen
One user, "@dokzetutarou," likened Kojiro to someone getting punched squarely on the cheek anime style. Image: Twitter/@on_nen
Kojiro's owner regularly updates the Twitter account with more of the cat's sleeping escapades. An Aug. 13 post saw Kojiro swapping its mat for a box where it could hang its chin on. /ra Image: Twitter/@on_ne
