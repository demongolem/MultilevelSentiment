ELKTON â€” A board quorum unanimously passed several amendments to Elkton's Fiscal Year 2018 budget, shifting dollars from one account to another to recognize payments for several of the town's notable endeavors this year.
Elkton Finance Director Steven Repole presented five budget amendments during Wednesday's town meeting, four of which authorized moving $171,500 combined from the town's unassigned fund balance to the general fund. The FY 2018 unassigned fund balance, considered as Elkton's "rainy day" savings account, was at $2.6 million.
Repole assured the commissioners that amending the last fiscal year's budget was normal, as Elkton had to account for what cash was in its coffers as it approaches its annual audit in the fall. FY 2018 ended on June 30, 2018.
"This is the normal course as we approach the end of the year," Repole assured the commissioners. "We approve the final expenditures and revenues received for items that weren't budgeted or went over budget, so we're clearing that up with these budget amendments now for the last fiscal year."
Breaking down the total moved from unassigned fund balance, $74,638 was recognized to purchase the 2.38 acres on Booth Street for the town's future community/recreation center, $40,000 to account for the over-expended waste removal account and $18,000 for the new boat ramp at Marina Park.
Cecil County originally agreed to transfer the undeveloped land behind the Cecil County Public School administration building for $78,000 and to waive fees associated with building the new Gilpin Manor Elementary School, but Repole said that the contractor had paid for those fees up front during final negotiations.
"We charged the county for the fees at Gilpin, and they paid us. So we paid them back, so it's a swap of the fees," Mayor Rob Alt said.
Elkton also spent more in waste removal services last fiscal year due to town officials cleaning out the homeless encampments at Meadow Park and Marina Park, according to town officials.
Other line items in the budget amendments included HVAC work at various town offices ($22,764) new special event speakers ($9,500) and 324 Hollingsworth Street, one of the blighted properties that town officials have targeted for demolition ($6,030).
The Hollingsworth Street house, which went to tax sale this year, is the first blighted property that the Town of Elkton is pushing to own outright once its tax bill is paid. Paying off the taxes and demolition costs could cost Elkton thousands more.
Repole also presented a budget amendment that would move $288,000 from the assigned fund balance to road maintenance projects. That revenue stream is paid through state Highway User Revenue (HUR), otherwise known as tolls, and can only be used for road maintenance.
"We went beyond the current year's receipts, but we had [$700,000] or $800,000 in that account from prior years," he said.
Alt and Commissioners Charles Givens and Earl Piner Sr. all voted to approve the budget amendments. Although Commissioners Mary Jo Jablonski and Jean Broomell were absent, the three men constituted a quorum, or a town board majority, that allowed matters to proceed. Under Elkton's charter, no ordinance or action would be approved without the favorable votes of a majority of the whole number of members elected to the board.
That means, even with Broomell and Jablonski absent, all actions taken on Wednesday night would need unanimous support from the three voting board members.
Repole also introduced two budget amendments for FY 2019, one to allocate $7,000 seized in Elkton Police Department's drug arrests for upgrades to EPD's bulletproof vests.
The second amendment recognizes $250,000 from Forest Conservation Fees and Critical Area Forest Mitigation Fees to buy 46.6 acres to create some sort of walking trail from Marina Park to neighborhoods near Whitehall Road. Although Alt originally planned to connect the path directly to Whitehall Road, pressure from Kensington Court residents dissuaded him from that plan. However, he still plans for some sort of primitive path extending to Marina Park.
The board quorum unanimously passed the two budget amendments for FY 2019
