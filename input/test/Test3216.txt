Major medical congresses to be held in Frankfurt Jun 18, 2018 Download press material
Frankfurt, represented by the Frankfurt Convention Bureau of the city's information centre Tourismus+Congress GmbH and Messe Frankfurt, has succeeded in securing two internationally renowned medical congresses for Frankfurt. The European Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation (EBMT) and the European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) have opted to hold their congresses in Frankfurt, choosing the city over a number of high-profile European alternatives. The annual convention of the European Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation (EBMT), which will be attended by an estimated 6,000 participants, is to be held at Messe Frankfurt's locations between 24 and 27 March 2019. The European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) convention, one of the largest European medical conventions with 15,000 participants, will then be held in Frankfurt between 3 and 6 June 2020.
This successful outcome can be attributed to the joint efforts of the city, the convention location and the scientific representatives â€“ as well as to the locational advantages, i.e. reachability, infrastructure and the quality and capacity of the venues.
Thomas Feda, Managing Director of Tourismus+Congress GmbH Frankfurt am Main: "We are proud that our efforts to position Frankfurt as a city with great charm, an excellent choice of hotels, tourism sights, shopping, art, culture, cuisine and an appealing cosmopolitan outlook have borne fruit. This has led to our city establishing itself in the eyes of the world as a medical conference venue as well." Uwe Behm, Member of the Executive Board of Messe Frankfurt GmbH, who is responsible for the entire congress business, adds: "We are very pleased at the success of these joint efforts, which once again show the advantages we offer and the excellent image we have as an international congress location. Our contribution to this is our expansive, state-of-the-art exhibition grounds with flexible and diverse conference facilities right in the heart of the city â€“ something that not many other European congress destinations can offer. As well as this, we offer a wide and customised spectrum of first-class services, ranging from logistics and catering to sophisticated technology for events of all kinds.
The fact that both European congresses are to be held in Frankfurt is also thanks to the hard work and commitment of the city's congress ambassadors â€“ Prof. Peter Bader (Head of Stem Cell Transplantation and Immunology at the Clinic for Paediatric and Adolescent Medicine, Frankfurt University Hospital), Prof. Thomas Klingebiel (Director of the Clinic for Paediatric and Adolescent Medicine, Frankfurt University Hospital) and Prof. Ulf MÃ¼ller-Ladner (Kerckhoff-Klinik GmbH, Department of Rheumatology, Bad Nauheim) â€“ who were tireless in their efforts to promote Frankfurt as a centre for medical conferences.
As Prof. Ulf MÃ¼ller-Ladner asserts: "We are regularly involved in organising national and international medical conventions, sometimes with more than 15,000 participants. From this experience, I can safely say that Frankfurt is in the Champions League of international congress destinations. The support provided by the well coordinated team of the City of Frankfurt and Messe Frankfurt shows the professionalism of the partners, as could be seen to great effect when the Rheumatology Congress was held in Frankfurt in 2016. As well as Frankfurt's unrivalled location in the centre of Europe with its own major airport, its locational advantages include the motorway junction and Europe-wide Intercity Express hub."
