The race to save the Great Barrier Reef<br />03:49<br />Saving Nemo<br />." It partners with schools to promote clownfish conservation and educate students about marine habitats.<br />At Belgian Gardens Primary School in the Australian city of Townsville, students volunteer to help breed baby clownfish.<br />"We breed them so we can give fish that we breed to people who want clownfish. So they don't have to take them out of the wild," explains 11-year old Imogen Everson<br />She and her classmates clean tanks, cultivate the artemia -- or sea monkeys -- used to feed clownfish, and they monitor the growth of hatchling clownfish.<br />Pupils at Belgian Gardens Primary School are helping to breed baby clownfish.<br />In one of the tanks, she identifies a small cluster of what appear to be bubbles that line the inside of a clay pot. They are clownfish eggs.<br />"The dad, the smaller clownfish, will always check on them ... and gives them oxygen," Everson says.<br />Ryan Pedley, the principal of the school, says captive-bred clownfish are later traded to pet stores for the aquarium supplies needed to help keep the program going.<br />"It's another way to immerse our students in reef ecology," Pedley says.<br />"The kids don't actually have to visit the reef. They can do their part by breeding clownfish in captivity and donate them to the fish shops."<br />Coral reef die-off<br />Marine biologists say in recent years, the clownfish has been confronted by a newer, potentially more destructive challenge: climate change.<br />Rising temperatures around the globe are bleaching and killing the coral reefs and the sea anemones with which clownfish share a symbiotic relationship.<br />In fact, in 2016 and 2017, successive marine heat waves killed off around half of the coral on Australia's Great Barrier Reef, the world's largest reef habitat.<br /
