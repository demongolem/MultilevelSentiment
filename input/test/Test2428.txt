New owners for troubled firm Envy By Sam Greenway 0 comment NEW owners have stepped in to save a firm with has strong ties to Worcestershire, after it went into administration.
Envy Haircare Limited has been purchased by the largest of the business' existing investors, and will now operate as Envy Logistics Limited.
The firm was originally launched in Newcastle in 2010 and sells a range of 21 luxury haircare products to more than 2,000 global customers such as wholesalers, retailers and high end hairdressing salons.
Envy Logistics Limited, which currently has five staff, operates from a 110,000 sq ft warehouse at AMCO Park in Redditch, and has its headquarters elsewhere in the Midlands.
The takeover will see the firm's new management inject fresh impetus into the company's marketing activity
Craig Povey, from administrators CVR Global, said: "Envy Haircare Limited had a range of uniquely-formed haircare products at its disposal that have been endorsed by an array of clients, but unfortunately the business wasn't growing at a fast enough pace. The new owners have a clear vision of how they are going to transform the business not just into one that is sustainable, but can continue to develop in the future in the UK and beyond.
