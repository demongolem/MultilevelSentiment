Fitzsimmons<br />Aug. 24, 2018<br />CHICAGO â€” Even in a city rife with distrust of law enforcement, residents were shocked by the sting operation: A tractor-trailer filled with Nike sneakers parked in an impoverished neighborhood on the South Side.<br />The â€œbait truckâ€� was left there earlier this month to lure would-be thieves into a trap, the authorities said. Three men were arrested on charges of stealing from the truck, prompting outrage in the community where faith in the police is already at a low point.<br />â€œYâ€™all are dirty,â€� one young man yelled at uniformed officers stationed near the truck in a<br />video that spread quickly online<br />. â€œYou wouldnâ€™t have did it in your neighborhood.â€�<br />The Chicago police, however, were playing a secondary role in the sting: â€œOperation Trailer Trapâ€� was led by Norfolk Southern Railway, with officers from its own police unit, and was orchestrated on Aug. 2 and 3 after several thefts of parked and locked freight trucks and containers in the immediate area. After the tactic was roundly criticized, the railroad company apologized and promised not to do it again. Prosecutors dropped burglary charges against the men.<br />But the damage was done. The operation may not have been the Chicago Police Departmentâ€™s idea, but it certainly bore the brunt of the backlash.<br />â€œYou donâ€™t bait people. You bait animals. Are you calling us animals?â€� Charles Mckenzie, an anti-violence activist who shot the video, said in an interview.<br />The failed operation comes at a tense time for Chicago, where<br />66 people were shot on a recent weekend<br />, another 58 were shot last weekend, and a police officer is expected to go on trial next month in connection to the 2014 killing of a black teenager. The death of the teenager, Laquan McDonald, roiled the city and led to murder charges against the officer, Jason Van Dyke.<br />[<br />Read: In Chicago, One Weekend, 66 Shooting Victims, and Zero Arrests<br />]<br />â€œThe reason this struck such a nerve is that we are at such a low point of trust between the police and the black community,â€� said Karen Sheley, a director at the American Civil Liberties Union of Illinois. â€œThe city has promised again and again to reform the police department.â€�<br />More than two weeks after the bait truck was deployed in a neighborhood where nearly all of the residents are black, resentment lingers over the episode. In a rebuke to the police, community groups plan to give away hundreds of pairs of donated shoes in the neighborhood this weekend â€” an idea the Chicago rapper Vic Mensa is calling the â€œanti-bait truck.â€�<br />Mr. Mensa, a Grammy-nominated artist who grew up on the cityâ€™s South Side, said he came up with the plan because he wanted to find a way to invest in the neighborhood. The timing of the sting operation â€” during a period of summer violence â€” was disrespectful, he said.<br />â€œTo see the police escort a bait truck full of shoes through a low-income neighborhood where people canâ€™t afford basic necessities, it seemed very representative of how ill-equipped they are to deal with the cityâ€™s issues,â€� Mr. Mensa said in an interview.<br />The â€œbait truckâ€� was left near 59th Place and Princeton Avenue in Englewood, a neighborhood where nearly 60 percent of the residents earn less than $25,000, according to 2015 census data. It is also among the most crime-ridden, though last year it recorded<br />fewer shootings<br />and other violence than in past years.<br />The Chicago police referred questions to Norfolk Southern, which said the action was in response to cargo thefts that had included guns and ammunition. Earlier this month, the Chicago police superintendent, Eddie Johnson, said he would take a â€œhard lookâ€� at the episode, but defended the motives behind it.<br />â€œThey had been experiencing a lot of theft of firearms over there, so we have a responsibility to keep these firearms off the street and out of the hands of the wrong people,â€� Superintendent Johnson told reporters.<br />Still, some critics have questioned why the Chicago police were involved at all, and encouraged the department to take responsibility, even if it only assisted with the arrests.<br />â€œIf you plan on doing a murder and I come with you to drive the getaway car, Iâ€™ll go to prison too,â€� Mr. Mensa said. â€œWhether or not the initiative was an idea generated by the police, theyâ€™re an accomplice.â€�<br />Initial reports said the police left the cargo truck open and that teenagers were targeted, but railroad officials said it was locked and the men who were arrested were between the ages of 21 and 59.<br />â€œThe suspects saw a parked, unmarked trailer and then proceeded to cut open the safety seal and broke into the back of the trailer and only then did they find retail shoes in unmarked brown boxes, previously secured and hidden inside,â€� said Susan Terpay, a spokeswoman for Norfolk Southern.<br />The railroad also provided video of the thefts, which shows several men inside the truck grabbing large brown boxes. Still, railroad officials apologized in a letter published in The Chicago Tribune.<br />â€œNorfolk Southern recognizes that, despite the need to safeguard freight in the area, this operation eroded trust between law enforcement and the community,â€� the letter said. â€œWe sincerely regret that our actions caused further unease, and we donâ€™t plan to use this method in the future.â€�<br />The idea of using expensive items to entice would-be thieves is not a new idea.
