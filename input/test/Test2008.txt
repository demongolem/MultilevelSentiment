WATCH | LIVESTATS ALBUQUERQUE, N.M. --- It's finally here. The official start of the 2018-19 athletic year at The University of New Mexico is here, and it begins with quite the test as UNM (12-8-2 in 2017) will take on the Texas Tech Red Raiders at 7:15 p.m. Central Time (6:15 p.m. Mountain Time) in Lubbock. While the Red Raiders, who went 8-6-3 last season, have won the last two matches (1-0 in 2015 and 2-1 in 2016), both were fairly tight affairs, and both came with the Red Raiders nationally ranked. Overall, the Lobos trail the all-time series 4-5-1. The game begins the fourth season for head coach Heather Dyche , who led the Lobos within a match of the NCAA Tournament last season. Dyche's overall record of 31-23-7 is the best among any Lobo coach after three seasons. Both teams are coming off exhibition wins, with the Lobos defeating CSU Pueblo 7-0 and Texas Tech defeating Denver 1-0. The Lobos enter the match with four returning starters, but plenty of seasoned vets as several players, including Jessica Nelson , weren't starters in 2017 but played significant minutes. The same can be said for Texas Tech presumed starting keeper Marissa Zucchetto, who played in all 19 matches a year ago, but only in the second half of the first 14 matches. She had a 1.05 goals against and one shutout, but was a part of five others. For UNM, played every minute last year with a 1.32 goals against and six shutouts. Each team enters with a proven goal scorer as well. For the Lobos, Jessie Hix had eight goals a year ago and two in the opening exhibition game, while Tech will counter with Ally Griffin, who had six goals and an assist a year ago. The game is the only one of the weekend for UNM, which returns home for a pair of matches on Friday against San Francisco at 5 p.m. and on Sunday against Idaho State at 1 p.m. NOTES: The game is free for all fans. Last year Texas Tech was 30th nationally in attendance ... UNM's last season opening win came on August 20, 2010 when the Lobos beat Montana 7-0. Since then they have went 0-5-2, losing the last five
