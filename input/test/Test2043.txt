Bancroft was found guilty of attempting to manipulate the condition of the ball on day three of the third Test against South Africa on March 24.
It was an act which led to widespread condemnation and also saw Australia captain Steve Smith and his deputy David Warner receive 12-month suspensions for their involvement.

Durham head coach Jon Lewis said: "Cameron provides us with a very talented overseas signing who can bulk up our batting line-up and help us compete for silverware.
"Tom Latham has done a great job for us over the past two seasons, but we anticipate Tom being unavailable due to the World Cup in 2019, therefore we were delighted to be able to bring Cameron in.
"Cameron is a talented top order batsman and a great talent across all formats. He has the appetite and temperament for scoring big runs.
