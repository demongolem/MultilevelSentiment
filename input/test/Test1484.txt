Live on the BBC Sport website, app, Red Button and iPlayer<br />One scored a famous Manchester City goal to cap an extraordinary FA Cup win.<br />Another went all the way in 1997 and lifted the famous trophy at Wembley wearing the blue of Chelsea.<br />On Saturday, Jon Macken and Frank Sinclair will start this season's FA Cup in the preliminary round together as manager and assistant manager of Radcliffe, of the Northern Premier League.<br />Watching the tie at neighbours Prestwich Heys will be Arsenal FA Cup winner Kevin Campbell, who acts as an "advisor" to Radcliffe.<br />Sinclair, Campbell and Macken made 659 Premier League appearances between them and scored a combined 93 top-flight goals.<br />Now the trio hope their wealth of first-tier experience can propel the Lancashire club to the FA Cup first round proper for the first time since 2000.<br />'Manager jobs are limited - you have to start somewhere'<br />Manchester City made Macken their<br />club record signing<br />after paying Preston North End &pound;5m for the striker in 2002.<br />Thirteen years on from his 43rd and final Premier League appearance for City, the 40-year-old is learning about life as a manager in the unforgiving eighth tier of English football.<br />"At this level you're always looking at what you can afford, looking to see if you can get a coach to take the team to a Saturday away game," said Macken, who played under the likes of Kevin Keegan at City, David Moyes at Preston and Neil Warnock at Crystal Palace.<br />Arguably his biggest moment during three years at City was heading the 90th minute winner as Keegan's 10-man team came from<br />3-0 behind to win 4-3 at Tottenham<br />in an FA Cup fourth round replay in 2004.<br />"They'll talk about this game long after we are dead and gone," said Keegan after his side's incredible comeback at White Hart Lane.<br />Macken played alongside the likes of Nicolas Anelka and David Seaman at City, yet he is grateful to Radcliffe for giving him his first break in management - even if it is a world away from the riches of full-time football.<br />Jon Macken and Frank Sinclair played on opposing sides in the FA Cup when Manchester City beat Leicester in 2004 - Macken scoring in the 3-1 third-round replay<br />"I've always wanted to be a manager but opportunities are limited," added Macken, who was<br />appointed last September.<br />"You can't just walk into jobs that are nice and cushy.<br />"There are lots of people fighting for the same job. You have to start somewhere and make a name for yourself."<br />Having finished third from bottom in the table last season, there are signs Macken is learning fast.<br />'We want to do a Salford'<br />Radcliffe have started this season with back-to-back wins, their latest success being a 4-1 home triumph over Clitheroe on Tuesday.<br />Former Everton and Arsenal striker Campbell, who helped the Gunners<br />win the FA Cup in 1993<br />, was among those in the midweek crowd of 243 at Neuven Stadium in Radcliffe, which is between Bolton and Bury.<br />"Kevin is part of the ownership who have put some money into the club to try and improve it," said Sinclair, who was<br />after spells managing Colwyn Bay and Hednesford.<br />"We want to do what Salford City have done and climb through the leagues.<br />"Kevin has a big say on a lot of the football matters. We're fortunate to have someone with the professional background that Kevin has got and a vision of where he wants to take the club."<br />Kevin Campbell (centre) celebrates Arsenal's title win in 1991 with team-mates David Seaman (left) and David Hillier<br />It is 21 years since Sinclair helped Ruud Gullit's Chelsea beat Middlesbrough 2-0 in the FA Cup final.<br />So how often does the 46-year-old look at his winner's medal?<br />"I'm not one for trophy cabinets," said the former Leicester and Burnley defender. "I've moved so many times that everything is boxed up in the loft."<br />'The Adie Moran derby'<br />Saturday's opponents Prestwich Heys play four miles down the road from Radcliffe at Adie Moran Park, named after the 10th-tier club's former player, manager and chairman.<br />Adie, whose non-league playing career also included a spell at Radcliffe, died in 2007 at the age of 43 after an<br />accident on holiday<br />in Sri Lanka.<br />"Adie was a real dynamo," said Heys secretary Scott White. "He was a driving force behind us getting back into the North West Counties League after we were demoted following a reorganisation."<br />Prestwich Heys have not progressed beyond the second qualifying round of the FA Cup in their 80-year history<br />While Radcliffe have a former player who went on to play in the Premier League in the shape of West Brom defender Craig Dawson, Heys also have a famous ex-player.<br />Manchester-born actor<br /
