The company's support page describes confidential mode in more detail. Google states that users can send messages and attachments with Gmail's confidential mode to help protect sensitive information from unauthorized access. They can use confidential mode to set an expiration date for messages or even revoke access at any time. (Users can choose from expiration options such as one week, one month, etc.) The confidential message's recipients will have the options to forward, copy, and print it, along with download disabled.
Google also notes that although confidential mode helps prevent the confidential email's recipients from accidentally sharing your email, it doesn't prevent them from taking screenshots or photos of the users messages and attachments. The company warns that recipients who have malicious programs on their computer may still be able to copy or download the user's messages and attachments. Also, the confidential mode feature isn't currently available for G Suite customers.
For users of the Gmail web client, Google's support page notes that confidential mode isn't available in classic Gmail. Users using Gmail with a work or school account will need to contact their administrator in order to use confidential mode.
