YOUR NEXT EMCEES: Che and NSK doing the most. PHOTO: Emmency Nuukala Emceeing a gig for 13 hours straight is not an easy job for anyone. However, Che Ulenga and NSK did just that this weekend at the 081Every1Fest. tjil spoke to the two masterminds on how they prepared, did the job and got some tips and tricks for emceeing festivals. A good emcee can make an outstanding event more entertaining. For Che, who treats each gig differently as no two jobs are ever alike, envisioning the show and the audience helps her host successfully. NSK on the other hand prepares to host for shows by doing research because as an emcee, understanding what the client wants to achieve matters the most."It was no different for the 081Every1Fest. There's no voodoo routine, lol. With research, everything falls into place," he said.Another crucial aspect of emceeing is being able to capture the audience and one way to succeed in this for Che is voice amplification. She says this is to capture the new audience who are yet to experience her job. NSK who refers to music as his wingman to start an event with a bang and says the first impression is important. He says it is contagious and it rubs off on the audience to keep them going too.Emceeing an event is exciting and one can easily derail and get off schedule. Both emcees agreed that ensuring that everyone is sticking to the set time is part of the success of the event and must be adhered to. "Keeping to time is imperative not only because Namibia has time regulations and laws and venues are booked until certain times, but also everyone who is involved in making the event successful is there booked for a certain number of hours. At the end of the day, it's really about respecting everyone's time," said Che.Overall the two had fun which was visible from their engagement with the audience by cracking jokes and having dance-offs now and then. NSK especially loved the energy from the audience and that each one of them came with the right mindset, which was to have a good time."As a result, the energy of the people gave every entertainer on the night the drive to leave it all on the stage or in the crowd...#FindDavidosShoes," he joked.In conclusion, both Che and NSK agreed that an emcee should never go blindly into an event to avoid blunders like mispronunciations. To anyone aspiring to be an emcee; be ready and remember someone spent their hard-earned money to be at that event. June Shimuoshil
