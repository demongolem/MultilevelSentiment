NEET MDS Preparation & NEET MDS Coaching Center in India (Self Study Vs Professional Coaching) - May 20, 2018 Hi there. In this post, I will share with you all, my experience of using videos/animations at DentalOrg.com and also in our community projects. In the 21st century as doctors and health professionals we all must know how to use videos in our profession. We cannot anymore depend on others/designers to create animations/videos for us. With that in mind, I am sharing with you all one video/animation tool that I have been personally using at DentalOrg.com. It is very easy to use with so many features. In my opinion, it is easy and perfect for everyone including health professionals. I hope after reading this more and more doctors and health professionals start using videos in their profession & community work. It's no secret that the use of video in social media, professional assignments, business aspects and real life are on the rise. And, it's certainly not a tactic to be taken lightly. You already know it. The moment you open your social media profiles or visit a website on the internet or just switching through TV channels â€“ Videos & Animations are everywhere. Some interesting video facts that show the growth in video consumption: At Youtube, in every 5 minutes, more than 10,000 videos are uploaded and at any given time there is a minimum 2 million people seeing videos on youtube. In facebook/twitter/google search, the contents that are receiving the maximum exposure are videos. Facebook, Twitter, and all major social media platforms/search platforms are pushing videos higher up on the news feed of people. Hence, whenever you open youtube, your facebook/twitter profile or google search, you will find dedicated video promotions and popular organic videos. People from various professions are trying to use videos to enhance their presence in their profession. So, can you as a health professional (a physician, doctor, dentist, physiotherapist) use animations and videos to add that extra spark to your professional practice & career? The answer is Yes, You Can & on your own. I do not know coding or video editing. It seems so difficult. I do not have time to learn how to use a new video editing software. I will outsource it to a video/animation designer (though he/she might charge 50 $ minimum per hour) Well, worry no more. In this post, we will talk about one amazing online tool that every health professional (who may or may not have any experience in video/animation creation) can use to create professional looking and beautiful animations/videos which can be used in a variety of scenarios â€“ from patient education, powerpoint presentations to professional promotions. We at DentalOrg.com have been using this easy & amazing tool to create beautiful & professionally looking videos to teach patients, students & our volunteers. It has made a huge difference in communicating our messages in social health services. Using Animatron, we are now able to create highly interactive and engaging videos & animations. These videos are very well received by our audience and have resulted in very successful health awareness campaigns. But Animatron can be used for academic, social media, social promotion and powerpoint presentations too. Using Animatron, some thing as routine and mundane as a powerpoint presentation can be made highly interactive. In this post, it is our aim to make you aware of this very useful software that you can use to take your professional work and presentations to a higher level. ANIMATRON â€“ The Most Advanced & Easiest online tool to create videos & animations Usually creating animated graphics takes a lot of time and work, but with Animatron , you can get professional quality work without even writing a single line of code. No Need To Install Any Complicated Software on your Devices Animatron is cloud-based software that allows you to create stunning videos, animations, banners, and infographics for desktops as well as mobile devices. Which means you do not need to Install any software to your device or worry about updating it regularly. All you need is a computing device (a desktop or a laptop) and an internet connection. That's the only two things you need to have and you are ready to create professional videos & animations for your work. Animatron is extremely easy to use. It is as easy as dragging and dropping to create informative animations & videos. Every doctor and health professional can use Animatron to add an extra dimension to their academics, patient education and professional promotion. Let's see what makes Animatron a great tool for all doctors & health professionals. Thousands of Free Assets/Clip Arts/Stock Videos/Animations/Images to use Animatron comes with thousands of preloaded materials that you can use to create amazing videos in a matter of minutes. The PRO membership of Animatron gets you the following assets: Library of 500K royalty-free video clips, audios, and photos. (If you try to purchase the stock videos separately from stock video sites then each good quality video will cost you around a minimum of 50 $) A collection of more than 2000 plus ready to use animated sequences. (Just drag, drop and add your texts) Royalty free HD videos grouped into various categories like technology, health care etc. (Again the health care stock videos are very high cost and will cost you a minimum of 75 $ each when purchased separately.) Royalty free background audios for the videos you create using Animatron. You are free to use all the assets without the worry of any copyright violation. Summary of the above 5 points & the biggest economic advantage of using Animatron : For making a professional quality video, you need to have High Definition professional stock videos, photos, and animations. The benefit is you can just add these videos, photos or animations directly with your texts to create a video. But the drawback â€“ A high-quality HD stock animation or video, from any of the TOP stock video/photo websites, will cost you a minimum of 50 $ each. That means if you buy two videos it is already costing you 100 $. Then again the video you bought after some time may not feel as the correct choice. Then you have very limited options to change the video or get a refund. In contrast, a single PRO version of Animatron will give you the option to use 500,000 High Definition Stock Videos & Photos including health professional videos. Just drag and drop to use the videos/photos. Don't like any particular video, remove it and replace it with another one at no extra charge. For example, see the screen recording below. I thought of creating a video related to dentists for one of my dentist friends. I searched for stock videos in some of the popular stock video websites. Each of the high definition stock videos or photos cost around 30$ and more. It was getting too pricey with limited options. I searched more for online tools that can help me make the video. While searching I came across Animatron. I immediately created an account & logged into the video creation area. Just see the screen recording and have a look how easy it gets to create the video with hundreds of free HD Videos/Photos present at Animatron â€“ all for 15$ only. (that is more than 60% less than the amount you will end up paying to a professional designer or to a stock video website) The video editing which you see in the screen record below was created in just 5 minutes. The video you see below is one of the simplest videos that you can create using Animatron . But as you keep using Animatron you will find thousands of amazing tools and effects. You & your video editor will be surprised by the professional quality video you just created sitting in front of your desktop and laptop. If you have used Microsoft Powerpoint then you will get used to using Animatron in a very short time. As you see in the video above, you just need to Drag & Drop the preloaded videos, animations or audios on to the design edit area and you are ready with your video. For example, let us say that you are a dentist and you want to create a short video & animation that you want to display at the entry door as the patients' exit or enter. But you do not want to spend thousands of your money or hours of time talking to a designer. Have a look at the video below made using Animatron. All I had to do was to drag & drop the royalty free videos & pre-made animations. In 5 minutes, I was ready with a video for my practice. Use Your Own Media to Create Videos for Your Practice Animatron gives you the option to use your videos & photos to upload to Animatron cloud. Once you have uploaded your videos, then you can add existing animations & stock photos/videos within the Animatron to create a perfect video. Import, place and edit your own graphics, photos, audio and video content. Easily annotate, splice, combine or overlay all of your media right on the canvas. Add in some animated text and branding elements in a flash. Infinite Customization of your Videos When you decide to use videos for patient education or the promotion of your professional health practice, it also comes with the pressure of creating a video that is in tune with your thoughts and ideas. If you have hired a designer to create a video for you then for every minor change or modifications you will have to spend more time & money. But if you are using Animatron, then you will have thousands of customization options to make the video as per your liking. These customizations are again Drag & Drop. Once you get used to the simple customizations then you will slowly get to know and use tons of other useful features to enhance your videos. The best part is you can do as many customizations as possible sitting comfortably in front of your computer, without needing to run to your designer every time. Exporting The Videos in various Formats As we have seen in this article, it is extremely easy to create an animated & stock video using Animatron. Once you complete designing your video, then is the time to export or save your video. Animatron gives you a variety of options to save the amazing video that you have created. You can save the video to your local storage device. You can upload the videos directly on to the social media platforms like Facebook, Twitter. You can also upload the videos to video platforms like Youtube and Vimeo to share them on various online platforms. You can also save your videos as a looping GIF picture file. We discussed the top features that make Animatron a very useful software for all the health professionals to create amazing videos for academics, patient education & practice promotion. We have been using Animatron at DentalOrg.com for some time now, and we can say without any doubt that every doctor & every health professional should use Animatron and use videos to increase the efficiency of their professional and academic career. See Next Slide to See How To Create Amazing PowerPoint Presentations Using Animatron Make your regular powerpoint presentation Different & Interesting We are discussing one the easiest video tools that health professionals and doctors can use to make amazing professional quality videos for education and practice. But that's is not all. Animatron also gives you the tools to create great powerpoint presentations. The regular powerpoint presentations that a health professional might use in patient education or academic presentations can be very dull in nature. It is no surprise that many of the people attending powerpoint presentations simply start getting a sleepy head. But using Animatron, you will be able to create amazing videos for your powerpoint presentations that will make patients/students/volunteers to sit up and take notice. You will be able to put across your ideas in a much better way. Rest assured that you will be able to influence more people than a boring regular powerpoint presentation. For example, I was assigned to attend a school in one of the most remote poor areas and teach young kids (& their parents) about healthy habits. Please note all of them were economically very backward and it was a challenge to explain them the ideas so that they will at least accept a few points. It was the middle of summer and as you should have guessed there were no fans or AC working. In such a scenario it is very difficult to grab the attention of the kids. So, I decided on using Animatron to create videos rather than just a regular powerpoint presentation. I was still not sure how the students/kids will react. Have a look at the presentation I created using Animatron. I started the Presentation with a 16 seconds animation. See it below â€¦ created using Animatron. This 16 seconds of video (created using Animatron), immediately grabbed the attention of the kids and parents equally from the very beginning. I have carried out many such programs previously but it was the first time, I was starting with an animated video. I could immediately notice the interest among the kids. Next, have a look at a small portion of the presentation. Again created using Animatron . This is just the first 1.5 minutes of the presentation. The entire presentation was of 30 minutes duration with videos and photo slides created using Animatron. All the components you see in the video above were created in a span of 30 minutes. I used the following Animatron components to create the video. Prebuilt Animations of Super Hero. Royalty free HD Stock videos of school and persons smoking. Royalty free music as the background music. Animatron Studio Video creation software. Animatron comes with a royalty free library of 500,000 stock videos , photos, and audios. It also provides more than 2000 pre-designed animation characters. As I mentioned in the previous slide, if you go about buying separate HD stock videos/photos from top stock video websites, it might cost you 50$ for a single video. But Animatron provides you the Library of 500,000 royalty free HD stock videos, photos, audios & animations that you can use or change as many times you need. For all this, you just need to spend 15$ per month. Anyone who is looking for HD stock videos/photos for their project will readily agree this is perhaps the best deal ever. Even if you have only one project which you would like to complete, a one-month membership will give you access to the entire library and Animatron online video creator. So, you can easily create multiple great videos & animations for your project for only 15$. That still saves you hundreds of dollars which otherwise you would have spent on purchasing separate multiple stock videos, photos, and audios. So, the entire process of creating the presentation using Animatron consisted of steps: Plan out your presentation points and write it down as a script. Open a new project in Animatron studio. Use the search option to search for Animations & HD Stock videos/photos from the Animatron library. Drag and drop the Stock Videos, Photos, and Animations that are suitable for your presentation. Add royalty free background audio from Animatron audio library. Choose and add effects, adjust timing to your project. Save your video to your storage device or upload it to Youtube/Vimeo. I would agree with anyone who says â€“ the essence of a presentation depends on the caliber of the presenter. That is the truth. But irrespective of whether a speaker is experienced or not, if he or she is equipped with a presentation material that can grab the attention of the people/students present in the room, then half of the work is done. The initial parts of the presentation you saw above, was able to grab the undivided attention of all the students and also of their parents. Together with my explaining capacity, the overall presentation was received very well by the school authorities and most importantly by the kids in the school. But the true happiness was to see the kids responding to the points mentioned. A regular powerpoint presentation might have made them sleep. But the Video/Photo/Animated presentation created using Animatron drove the points. Conclusion: As a doctor and health professional, I always feel that doctors must adapt to the changing trends in technology and internet. The video is one such trend. But due to lack of time, many doctors & health professionals are not able to use this medium as effectively as they can. They have to depend on other designers. More than money, it results in the loss of more time. But Animatron is one such tool that can help you in creating professional HD videos in a matter of minutes. And one you get a hang of Animatron, then you will be creating absolute masterpieces. To summarize, here are the benefits of using Animatron for Doctors & Health Professionals. On-line software. So you can use it anytime & anywhere. All you need is laptop and internet. Great value for money. As mentioned in this post, for 15 $ per month you get the access to all the Video/Photo library of Animatron. Huge library (500,000) of Royalty Free stock videos, photos, audios (including amazing video of various health professions). Just Drag, Drop, Edit & Add Text. Your video is ready. Use Animatron to create Patient Education Videos, Health Awareness Videos, Classroom Videos, Social Media Videos. You can also use Animatron to create Professional Quality videos for Social Media promotion of your professional set up. Stand out in seminars and meeting by presenting your ideas using animation & videos. Be different from your colleagues who are still using the boring regular powerpoint point presentations. I hope, this post will motivate you to use animations and videos more in your professional career as a doctor and health professional.
