Orbis Research - Friday, August 17, 2018. An instrument transformer is used to obtain measurements of voltage or current levels or both in different high-voltage/high-current systems such as in transmission or distribution lines or industries. An instrument transformer convert current or voltage from a high level to a very low level before passing it to measuring instruments, effectively isolating the measurement devices from the high voltage or current on the line. As for the global instrument transformer industry, the industry structure is relatively stable. The most of market share in revenue is grasped by the top three manufacturers, Siemens, ABB and GE, which closes to 50 per cent totally. The Germany giant Siemens, which has 21.63% market share in 2017, is the leader in the instrument transformer industry. The manufacturers following Siemens are ABB and GE, which respectively has 12.80% and 14.93% market share globally. The DYH is the leader of China instrument transformer industry. It sells a total of 185.77 million dollar instrument transformer products in the year of 2017.
