A hurricane of this magnitude so close to Hawaii is â€œa very rare event,â€� said Alex Gibbs of the National Weather Serviceâ€™s Central Pacific Hurricane Center in Honolulu.<br />Photo<br />Talbot Khakai, left, and David Halafihi boarded up windows in Honolulu on Wednesday in preparation for Hurricane Lane.<br />Credit<br />Kat Wade/Getty Images<br />In 1992, another storm, Hurricane Iniki, veered into Kauai as a Category 4 storm. It killed six people and caused about $3 billion in damage, leveling more than 1,400 homes and damaging about 14,000. Power and phone lines were out for weeks, and crops like banana and papaya were destroyed.<br />Direct hits on Hawaii are unusual, in part because the islands are small in comparison to the rest of the Pacific Ocean. Other conditions that make Hawaii an infrequent target of hurricanes include the cooler water temperatures near the islands and wind shear, which weakens storms.<br />Forecasters say that both factors are expected to influence Hurricane Lane in the coming hours. The stormâ€™s exact track is uncertain, and it is was expected to weaken slightly. Still, the storm promises to bring heavy damage to the main Hawaiian islands as its winds surge through steep mountain slopes and tall buildings. The fact that Lane is moving slowly means that it is likely to dump large amounts of rain.<br />On Thursday, the outer bands of the storm lashed the Big Island, swelling creeks and rivers and triggering road-blocking landslides. Nearly 20 inches of rain had been recorded at one observation station. Officials said that hundreds of people on the island of Oahu had already moved to shelters by afternoon, and a warning siren was sounded.<br />â€œHurricane Lane is still a dangerous and powerful storm,â€� Mr. Ige warned at<br />a news conference Thursday<br />.<br />Although climate change does not cause hurricanes, climate experts said that it can make storms like Lane more damaging.<br />The storm was approaching Hawaii on Wednesday.<br />Kristen Corbosiero, an assistant professor with University at Albanyâ€™s atmospheric and environmental sciences department, said that scientific research shows that climate change has led to rising sea levels, which can worsen storm surge. In addition, she said, warmer temperatures put more moisture in the atmosphere, producing greater rainfall, which in a place like Hawaii means greater flooding and mudslides.<br />Advertisement<br />Continue reading the main story<br />Recent research also suggests that climate change has led to storms moving more slowly, she said. â€œThose all spell greater damage from hurricanes.â€�<br />Lane was unwelcome news for some of the almost 300,000 tourists on the islands this week. Stephanie and Marc Johnston of Melbourne, Australia, cut their honeymoon short to leave on Wednesday, before the rains began. But Vicky Maywald, a Texan who was vacationing with five family members, was sticking to her Oahu vacation.<br />Newsletter Sign Up<br />Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.<br />Invalid email address.
