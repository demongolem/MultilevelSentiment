We believe intense market focus on lumateperone in schizophrenia as the primary value driver could dissipate somewhat with evidence that pipeline assets/ indications could bear fruit. By the time the schizophrenia indication may be viewed as viable, we believe it could embody a far smaller commercial opportunity relative to the aggregate potential of the pharmacophore and ITI-214 in other indications."" 8/2/2018 â€“ Intra-Cellular Therapies was given a new $31.00 price target on by analysts at Canaccord Genuity. They now have a "buy" rating on the stock. 7/23/2018 â€“ Intra-Cellular Therapies had its "buy" rating reaffirmed by analysts at Cantor Fitzgerald. They now have a $28.00 price target on the stock. They wrote, ": We reiterate our Overweight rating and $28 PT for ITCI stock. We believe investors should be optimistic about lumateperone's future, but we recognize that skepticism persists about its approvability as a treatment for schizophrenia. We note that the drug candidate is also being tested in bipolar depression and agitation related to dementia. Overlooked, given the intense focus on lumateperone, may be ITCI's phosphodiesterase (PDE) enzyme platform. As clinical evidence emerges from ITCI's PDE inhibitor portfolio, we believe alternative sources of share value creation should come into focus."" 7/6/2018 â€“ Intra-Cellular Therapies was upgraded by analysts at BidaskClub from a "sell" rating to a "hold" rating. 6/27/2018 â€“ Intra-Cellular Therapies was downgraded by analysts at ValuEngine from a "buy" rating to a "hold" rating. 6/22/2018 â€“ Intra-Cellular Therapies was downgraded by analysts at BidaskClub from a "hold" rating to a "sell" rating.
