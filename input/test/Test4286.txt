Sometimes, when you're sitting in front of the idiot box and trying to make sense of the meaningless images contained therein, you have to try and ascertain the difference between what a television show is showing and what a television show is saying.
Twin Peaks , for example, shows you that murdering beauty queens and wra-a-aping them in plastic is cool and mysterious. What it is saying, on the other hand, is that you should never trust short people. Particularly those whose arms bend back. See? Should make complete sense now.

Playing in 5 ... Don't Play When it comes to the new comedy series Insatiable (Netflix, on demand) the first thing you have to get past is the waist-deep sea of bad reviews. There's an ocean of them out there. Short summary: some people hate this show. Longer summary: some people really, really, really hate this show.
Capsule plot: Patty Bladell (Debby Ryan) is an overweight high school kid who is punched by a homeless guy and, after three months with her jaw wired shut, emerges slim and vengeful. Her lawyer Bob Armstrong (Dallas Roberts) moonlights as a beauty pageant consultant and persuades Patty to become his protege.

Variety said, "neither the show's punchlines nor its characters are sharp enough to transcend their cliched foundations". AV Club said it, "purports to be satire, playing every bit of offensive dialogue and questionable storyline for laughs, yet none of it is funny".
And Vanity Fair , in what might be described as one of the more flattering reviews of the show, called it a "would-be binge-watch [that is] so sloppy that it borders on inadvertent brilliance". Just to ice that cake, Vanity Fair even wondered if Netflix's algorithm had produced the show without human input.
So, here's the thing. The bottom line messaging â€“ that high school kids are shallow, that appearances don't matter, that everyone's revenge on their detractors is a life lived in full colour â€“ is sound. The problem here might be what you have to tackle in order to get there, which is, a big dose of fat-shaming.
Insatiable aspires to be Mean Girls, but it's missing a key element: empathy.
Insatiable aspires to be Mean Girls , but that film was tempered powerfully by a strong seam of empathy woven into the script by writer Tina Fey, coupled with a more dimensional heroine in Lindsay Lohan's Cady.
Insatiable 's Patty is written, aside from slivers of self-doubt that manifest periodically, as shallow and narcissistic. Biggest problem: you're never quite sure if you like her. Her sidekick is one-note lesbian high schooler Nonnie (Kimmy Shields). And her potential love interest is one-note brooding preacher's son-turned-bad boy Christian (James Lastovic).
Some of the show's other supporting players offer a glimmer of salvation â€“ Christopher Gorham's Bob Barnard, Alyssa Milano's Coralee Armstrong and Carly Hughes' Etta Mae Barnard â€“ and collectively elevate the show from a pale cousin of Heathers to something more like Robert Harling's underrated Good Christian Bitches .
The intellectuals will tell you the show is bad because its messaging is off. But Insatiable stumbles for far more fundamental reasons: it lacks dimension, its characters are unsteady on their narrative feet and while it might seem funny, irreverent and boundary-pushing at times, it lacks those characteristics in enough volume to sustain itself
