Do hormonal contraceptives cause cancer?
Hormonal contraceptives do not appear to cause breast cancer. However, if you have breast cancer now, or have had it in the past, do not use hormonal contraceptives because some breast cancers are sensitive to hormones.
Women who use hormonal contraceptives may have a slightly higher chance of getting cervical cancer . However, this may be due to other reasons such as having more sexual partners.

Read this Instructions for Use carefully before you decide if Annoveraâ„¢ is right for you. This information does not take the place of talking with your gynecologist or other health-care provider who specializes in women's health.

How should I start using Annoveraâ„¢?
If you are not currently using hormonal birth control, start using Annoveraâ„¢ between days 2 and 5 of your menstrual period. If your menstrual periods are not regular or if you start using Annoveraâ„¢ more than 5 days from when you started your menstrual period, you should use a barrier method of birth control, such as a male condom or spermicide during sexual intercourse for the first 7 days you use Annoveraâ„¢.
If you are changing from a birth control pill or patch or monthly disposable contraceptive vaginal ring to Annoveraâ„¢:
If you have been using your birth control method correctly and are certain that you are not pregnant, you can change to Annoveraâ„¢ any day of your birth control cycle. Do not start Annoveraâ„¢ any later than the day you would start your next birth control pill, apply your next patch or insert your next monthly disposable contraceptive vaginal ring.
If you are changing from a progestin-only birth control method, such as a minipill, injection, implant or intrauterine system (IUS): You may switch from a minipill on any day. Start using Annoveraâ„¢ on the day that you would have taken your next minipill. You should switch from an injectable and start using Annoveraâ„¢ on the day when your next injection would be due. You should switch from an implant or the IUS and start using Annoveraâ„¢ at the time the implant or IUS is removed.
If you are changing from a minipill, injection, implant, or an intrauterine system to Annoveraâ„¢, you should use a barrier method of birth control, such as a male condom or spermicide, during sexual intercourse for the first 7 days you use Annoveraâ„¢.
If you start using Annoveraâ„¢ after an abortion or miscarriage: Following a first trimester abortion or miscarriage: You may start Annoveraâ„¢ within 5 days following a first trimester abortion or miscarriage (the first 12 weeks of pregnancy). You do not need to use an additional birth control method.
If you do not start Annoveraâ„¢ within 5 days after a first trimester abortion or miscarriage, use a non-hormonal birth control method, such as male condoms or spermicide, while you wait for your menstrual period to start. Start using Annoveraâ„¢ between days 2 and 5 of your menstrual period. If you start using Annoveraâ„¢ more than 5 days from when you started your menstrual period, you should use a barrier method of birth control, such as a male condom or spermicide during sexual intercourse for the first 7 days you use Annoveraâ„¢. Following a second trimester abortion or miscarriage: You may start using Annoveraâ„¢ no sooner than 4 weeks (28 days) after a second trimester abortion (after the first 12 weeks of pregnancy).
If you are starting Annoveraâ„¢ after childbirth: You may start using Annoveraâ„¢ no sooner than 4 weeks (28 days) after having a baby if you are not breastfeeding. If you have not gotten your menstrual period after childbirth, you should talk to your health-care provider. You may need a pregnancy test to make sure you are not pregnant before you start using Annoveraâ„¢. Use another birth control method, such as a male condom or spermicide, during sexual intercourse for the first 7 days you use Annoveraâ„¢ if you have not yet had a period.
If you are breastfeeding you should not use Annoveraâ„¢. Use other birth control methods until you are no longer breastfeeding.
How doI use Annoveraâ„¢?
Step 1. Open the package and remove Annoveraâ„¢. Wash your hands with mild soap and water. Dry them well. Take Annoveraâ„¢ out of its package (See Figure, Step 1). Wash Annoveraâ„¢ with mild soap and water, rinse and pat dry with a clean cloth towel or paper towel.
Step 2. Prepare to insert Annoveraâ„¢. Hold Annoveraâ„¢ between your thumb and first (index) finger. Press the sides of Annoveraâ„¢ together to make it narrow (See Figure, Step 2).
Step 3. Choose a position for insertion of Annoveraâ„¢. Choose the position that is comfortable for you. For example, lying down, squatting, or standing with 1 leg up (See Figures, Steps 3-A, 3-B, 3-C).
Step 4. Insert Annoveraâ„¢ into your vagina. Gently insert the folded Annoveraâ„¢ into your vagina (See Figure, Step 4-A). Push Annoveraâ„¢ further up into your vagina using your index finger. Push it in as far as you can. It sometimes helps to push down with the muscles in your vagina while you are inserting Annoveraâ„¢. When you insert Annoveraâ„¢ it may be in different positions in your vagina, but Annoveraâ„¢ does not have to be in an exact position for it to work. Mark your vaginal system "in day" on your calendar.
Note: If you feel the Annoveraâ„¢ in your vagina or if it feels uncomfortable, you may not have pushed the Annoveraâ„¢ into your vagina far enough. Use your index finger to gently push Annoveraâ„¢ as far as you can into your vagina (See Figure, Step 4-B). There is no danger of Annoveraâ„¢ being pushed too far up in the vagina or getting lost. You should not feel Annoveraâ„¢ after you have placed it into your vagina. Some women and their partners may be aware of Annoveraâ„¢ in the vagina during sexual intercourse.
Step 5. How do I remove Annoveraâ„¢? Wash and dry your hands. Choose the position that is most comfortable for you (See Step 3). Put your index finger into your vagina and hook it through Annoveraâ„¢. Gently pull downward and forward to remove Annoveraâ„¢ and pull it out (See Figure, Step 5). It sometimes helps to push down with the muscles in your vagina while you are removing Annoveraâ„¢. Wash the Annoveraâ„¢ vaginal system with mild soap and lukewarm water, pat it dry, and store in the case provided. Mark your vaginal system "out day" on your calendar.
What else should I know about Annoveraâ„¢? The day of the week when you first insert Annoveraâ„¢ (called "Day 1") is your vaginal system change day. This is described further in the Patient Information section entitled "How should I use Annoveraâ„¢?" For each cycle, you put the vaginal system into your vagina and let it stay there 3 weeks (21 full days). Remember to keep the vaginal system in for the whole 3 weeks (21 full days). You take the vaginal system out on your vaginal system change day (Day 22) and let it stay out for 1 week (7 full days). Note that your vaginal system should be stored in the case provided, away from children, pets, and extreme temperatures. Then you start over again for another 4 weeks. You may not be bleeding when you put the vaginal system in. Always put the vaginal system in or take it out on your vaginal system change day at about the same time of day. For example, if you put your vaginal system in on Monday at 9:00 in the morning, always take it out or put it back in on Monday at about 9:00 in the morning. You do not have to take the vaginal system out when you have sex. If you decide to remove it, remember to reinsert it within 2 hours after removing it or you may not be protected from pregnancy. However, if Annoveraâ„¢ is out of your vagina for more than 2 hours at one time or if Annoveraâ„¢ is out of your vagina at different times that add up to more than a total of 2 hours over the first 21 days of your cycle, you will need to use another method of birth control until Annoveraâ„¢ has been in your vagina for 7 days in a row, such as male condoms or spermicides. Repeat the 4-week cycle for all 13 cycles of the use of the vaginal system. Do not use the vaginal system for more than 13 cycles (1 year). When you take the vaginal system out of your vagina at the end of the 13 cycles, dispose of it. See "How should I dispose of (throw away) Annoveraâ„¢?" below. If you want to continue using Annoveraâ„¢ after 13 cycles, you will need to get a new prescription from your health-care provider to obtain a new vaginal system. Do not use any vaginal products such as oil-based suppositories, oil-based creams, or oil-based gels while the vaginal system is in your vagina. Do not use any vaginal lubricants that have silicone or oil in them. Water-based lubricants are ok to use. Be sure to read the ingredients on the labels carefully before you buy a vaginal lubricant . Do not take any medicines unless your health-care provider says it is ok to take them. Tell your health-care provider when you start a new medicine.
How do I clean Annoveraâ„¢? After removing Annoveraâ„¢ from your vagina, wash it with mild soap and warm water, rinse, and pat it dry with a clean cloth towel or paper towel before you store it. Only use mild soap and warm water to clean. Wash Annoveraâ„¢ with mild soap and warm water and pat it dry before you put it back into your vagina. Store Annoveraâ„¢ in the case provided.
How should I store Annoveraâ„¢? Store Annoveraâ„¢ at room temperature between 68Â°F to 77Â°F (20Â°C to 25Â°C). Protect Annoveraâ„¢ from direct sunlight. Do not refrigerate or freeze Annoveraâ„¢.

When does Annoveraâ„¢ become effective?
Annoveraâ„¢ becomes effective on the day it is inserted (Day 1) if it is inserted between days 2 and 5 of your menstrual period. If Annoveraâ„¢ is inserted more than 5 days from when you start your menstrual period, you should use a barrier method of birth control, such as a male condom or spermicide, during sexual intercourse for the first 7 days you use Annoveraâ„¢.
Will Annoveraâ„¢ interfere during sexual intercourse? If Annoveraâ„¢ is placed as high as possible in your vagina, it will not interfere with sexual intercourse.
Can I take Annoveraâ„¢ out during the first 3 weeks of my cycle? You should leave Annoveraâ„¢ in the entire 21 days (3 weeks). If Annoveraâ„¢ comes out or if you remove it, put it back in as soon as possible. If you put Annoveraâ„¢ back into your vagina before 2 hours has passed, you do not need to use another method of birth control. However, if Annoveraâ„¢ is out of your vagina for more than 2 hours at one time or if Annoveraâ„¢ is out of your vagina at different times that add up to more than a total of 2 hours over the first 21 days of your cycle, you will need to use another method of birth control until Annoveraâ„¢ has been in your vagina for 7 days in a row, such as male condoms or spermicides.
What should I do if Annoveraâ„¢ comes out of my vagina?
Annoveraâ„¢ can slip or accidentally come out of your vagina (expelled), for example, during sexual intercourse, bowel movements, or use of tampons. If Annoveraâ„¢ slips out of your vagina, wash Annoveraâ„¢ with mild soap and warm water, rinse and pat dry with a clean cloth towel or paper towel and put it back in your vagina right away or within 2 hours. See "Can I take Annoveraâ„¢ out during the first 3 weeks of my cycle?" in the section above. Annoveraâ„¢ can move around and become visible at the opening of your vagina. If this happens follow "Step 4" above for directions on how to push Annoveraâ„¢ back to its right position.
What if I lose Annoveraâ„¢? Call your health-care provider right away if you lose Annoveraâ„¢. You should use a back-up method of birth control such as a male condom or spermicide for preventing pregnancy until you get a new Annoveraâ„¢.
