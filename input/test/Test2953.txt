Hoover News chronicles life of company, employees Jessica Holbrook CantonRep.com business writer @JHolbrookREP 35 AM Several exhibits on the Hoover News are on display at the Hoover Historical Center.
NORTH CANTON For nearly 90 years, the Hoover Co. kept its community in the know through the Hoover News.
The company newsletter â€” which published as The Newsy News until October 1955 â€” chronicled product launches, corporate happenings, employee milestones and sometimes local gossip.
"This is such a crazy resource of just every bit of information about what was going on from 1917 until 2005," said Megan Pellegrino, curator of the Hoover Historical Center at Walsh University.
Several Hoover News exhibits are on display at the center through October.
The project is the culmination of hundreds of hours of work. Operations Coordinator Ann Haines read every issue of the publication in anticipation of the 100th anniversary last year. Her notes led to the exhibits, which are display by era and include highlights and history of the publication.
The center also has digitized every issue from 1919 onward. It's available to view by appointment.
"It's going to be a wonderful historical reference. It'll be a great resource," Haines said, adding that she's already used the archives in her own projects.
The newsletters are filled with information about former Hoover employees. The center can help those who want to research their family members, Pellegrino said.
It's also being used by other historians. The U.S. Army Women's Museum recently sought information about a Hoover employee who was in the first wave of Women's Army Auxiliary Corps sent to Europe during World War II.
The center sent clippings and photographs that will be on display at the museum in Virginia, Pellegrino said.
World War I
In 1917, the U.S. was plunged into World War I.
Like many cities, North Canton â€” then New Berlin â€” saw its young men join the military and leave home. Many of them were employed by the Hoover Co., which spent those years focused on wartime production.
William H. "Boss" Hoover wanted to keep "his boys" informed about what was going on back home.
Enter the Newsy News. A group of New Berlin residents formed the Our Laddies Welfare Association -- Boss Hoover was president and Esta Stoner the editor -- to organize "the sentiment of the community along helpful lines for the purpose of keeping in touch with the life and lives of our boys who have been called to the colors...," according to information from the Hoover center.
The first edition in September 1917 was hand-typed and copies sent to the 10 military training camps in the U.S.
The Newsy News proved popular and soon New Berlin residents wanted copies of their own.
"It almost became like the town newspaper," Pellegrino said.
A committee worked on the weekly publication, some assigned to cover news from different Hoover departments, others gathering church news and social gatherings, Haines said.
Photographs shot by H.W. Hoover, Boss' son and the second company president, including shots of the town's victory celebration, were glued onto the pages.
In every issue, Boss Hoover would write a letter to the troops. Some of those serving would write back and their letters and pictures would be published. Others would use the Newsy News to send messages to friends and family.
"I am expecting to take our three Ladies Fair to dinner at Benders, Saturday Evening, September 29th. We, the four of us, can talk over the times that might have been had you and Jack been here," a teasing writer named Andy wrote in a message addressed to Spikes under the heading "Just By The Way."
"Early issues and even into the '20s, they're kind of gossipy. It's kind of funny," Pellegrino said.
Post-war
The publications popularity remained after the war.
With the "boys" back home, the publication shifts more into covering company news.
By 1919, it was renamed The Hoover Newsy News and more than 1,300 copies were printed each week.
Over time, it was sent to Hoover employees, retirees and dealers around the world, Pellegrino said. A section called Canadian Capsule focused on those employees across the border. In England, Hoover launched another newsletter named The Dustpan.
The Newsy News would eventually become a monthly publication. Publication ceased briefly from 1932 to June 1934 during the Great Depression. And issues weren't published during the annual summer shutdown, which usually took place in July, Haines said.
Issues would chronicle the growth of Hoover and the city -- an iconic photo of the Hoover smokestacks construction first ran in the newsletter.
They also would recognize employee milestones such as work anniversaries, births and deaths. Those who were getting married had their pictures published. Writers published articles on employees with interesting hobbies or after-work activities.
Hoover would use the newsletter to announce new product launches or showcase new ad campaigns.
For decades, issues contained comic strips done by artist and longtime Hoover Co. Art Director Ellsworth Smith. Some of those are on display in a separate exhibit at the center.
"He was North Canton's Norman Rockwell. He really was," Haines said.
Back to war
During World War II and the Korean War, the focus turned back to employees in the military. Issues contained lists of serving and those who'd died.
The issues delved into war efforts at home, such as car clubs to conserve gas and rubber and victory parties on Hoover property, Pellegrino said.
"It's this amazing wealth of information," she said.
Some articles might raise eyebrows today, including one that featured a "Hoover Pin-Up Parade" with women posing in swimsuits.
"It's a sign of the time. It's a little sexist but that's the way it was," Haines said.
Exhibit
Because the Hoover News ran until 2005, many former Hoover employees are probably familiar with the publication.
"I don't know if people are aware that it was around so long. I don't know if they know the history behind it," Haines said.
The exhibit has drawn some attention, but the Center hopes that once people realize how important the newsletter is, they'll be more interest in viewing the displays or using the archives to conduct their own research.
"There's so many cool things. So many facets of our history ... There's so many stories in the story. It's such a great legacy," Haines said.
