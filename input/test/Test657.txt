There is also uncertainty over the future status of the U.K. within the EU's infectious disease database, a system that allows pathogens to be spotted early and their spread to be tracked more easily across the Continent, Thompson said. He urged negotiators to "very quickly agree" ongoing participation for the U.K.
"If you think about the number of patients that arrive in Europe through Heathrow, for the U.K. and Europe not to be working on one infectious disease database, [that] will not be understood by patients," he said. "So there are some really simple things that we would expect now to be very quickly agreed and put in place, otherwise we're going to be putting patients at risk."

In a parallel to the dispute over U.K. participation in the Galileo satellite program , which led to U.K. officials accusing the EU of taking an overly "legalistic" approach to negotiations, the EU has so far indicated that as a third country the U.K. would be shut out of shared drug databases. An EMA planning document for the "EudraVigilance" drug safety database in June stated that "applications supporting the approval and safety monitoring of medicines across the EU would have to be closed to the UK" after March 2019. The document makes no mention of a Brexit transition period agreed provisionally between the EU and U.K. negotiators in March, and it is not clear whether that would apply. Preparing for the worst
With growing fears of a no-deal Brexit â€” Trade Secretary Liam Fox put the odds at 60-40 earlier this month â€” a number of firms in the U.K. and Europe have begun speaking publicly about their stockpiling plans, with fears that trade and regulatory disruptions could slow down the supply of medicines across borders. AstraZeneca said last month it would increase its stock supply in Europe by around 20 percent, while major insulin-manufacturer Sanofi and Swiss firm Novartis have also set out stockpiling plans in recent weeks.
The U.K.'s health and social care secretary, Matt Hancock, told the House of Commons health committee last month that the government is actively "working with industry to prepare for the potential need for stockpiling."
Thompson said that while preparations in the U.K. are moving more quickly, readiness for no-deal was a "pan-European issue and patients in Europe are just as impacted."
"Understandably, Brexit is higher up the government's agenda in the U.K. than it is in other member states, therefore the U.K. has been moving at a faster pace in terms of thinking through some of the issues. You see now government ministers in the U.K. actively discuss things like stockpiling, which you're yet to see across other member states," he said.
"I think that's good for U.K. patients but I'm concerned about patients across the continent of Europe because I think it will have an impact for everybody."

Thompson also urged the EU to "have a little think" about the future of its life sciences sector, warning that a clean break between the U.K. and the wider EU's pharmaceutical sectors could see drug firms downgrading the EU in favor of the U.S. and Asia for future research opportunities.
"Life sciences tends to operate regionally," he said. "You have the U.S.; you have Europe; you have an Asian bloc â€¦ at the moment Europe is heading toward being third in that list of priorities for most companies â€¦ The U.K. is the third largest biopharmaceutical cluster outside of the East and West Coast of the United States. I can't see why, at this moment, pushing the U.K. away makes any strategic sense," he said.
A U.K. Department of Health and Social Care spokesperson said: "We want a deal with the EU that is good for the U.K. and good for the health service. That is why we have continued to work closely with the European Union to ensure there is no disruption to the NHS [National Health Service] after we leave.
"Alongside that, we are continuing to work with industry in the unlikely event of a no-deal Brexit so patients continue to receive top quality care."
A European Commission spokesperson said: "Discussions on the framework of the future EU-U.K. relationship are ongoing.
