With applications still open until Thursday, September 20, the University of Hull is on a mission to reveal the truth about Clearing.
So, if you're thinking of changing your course, switching your career or getting back into studying, they've got a message for you - there's still time. Revealed: the truth about Clearing
You may think Clearing is just for students who don't get the grades for their chosen university. But you'd be surprised. Clearing isn't just for students who don't get the grades for their chosen university
The truth is, there are many reasons why you'd go through Clearing. You may have done better than you thought you would, and want to switch universities. You may have changed your mind about what you want to study. Read More
You may have just decided to go to uni last minute, without applying before. You may be looking for a career change, or just want to study the subject you've always loved. It's an opportunity, not a last resort
It's how thousands of students get on to the best course at the best university for them, students like Eleanor Smith, who studied BA War and Security Studies at the University of Hull.
She said: "I'm now at a better university than the ones I originally applied for because of Clearing and choosing a foundation year.
"My advice to others is to be just as enthusiastic about your Clearing options as your original application." It's not just about your grades
If your grades aren't what you hoped for, don't panic. You've still got plenty to offer, and there are doors still open to you. Universities like Hull look at your whole application: volunteering, work experience, and achievements outside of school and college .

Tayo Adeleye, Business Economics and Marketing student at Hull, said: "Don't be afraid to ask for what you want. Even if you didn't get the grades you wanted, universities do look at other things."
Each year, students come to Hull through Clearing because of unexpected grades, and they go on to flourish on their degree courses. It's not as scary as you might think
Six words. That's all you need to say. "I want to apply through Clearing." Then the person over the phone will talk you through the rest.
Deborah Akinwumi, a Law student who applied through Clearing, said of her experience: "Clearing was pretty simple: I just called up and got a place. Hull were very reassuring, and I got to visit the uni before I accepted." It's not too late
