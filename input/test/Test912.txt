South African group MTN competes for Angola's fourth telecom operator license 17 August 2018 | Angola
South African mobile group MTN will compete for the fourth telecom operator license in Angola, the group's chief executive told South African daily newspaper Financial Mail.
"Angola has started the formal process of granting a fourth license and we are participating," said Rob Shuter, according to whom it is a process that "will still take some time."
Angolan newspaper Novo Jornal reported that the MTN group, founded in 1994 and present in 24 countries, has joined the Vodafone group in the race to become the fourth telecommunications operator in Angola.
In Angola, three global operators are licensed to provide voice, data and Internet services: Angola Telecom, Unitel and Movicel.
At the end of November 2017, the Minister of Telecommunications and Information Technologies, JosÃ© Carvalho da Rocha, said the fourth operator would not only for mobile telecommunications, but would be granted a global license, which would allow other services, such as pay-TV.
The minister said that the decision aims to improve the efficiency of the sector by introducing more competition that could bring gains for potential users of these services.
Carvalho da Rocha said earlier this month that the valuation of Angola Telecom's assets for the privatisation of 45% of its share capital is in the final phase.
The minister added that the government intends to start the process of partial privatisation of Angola Telecom as soon as the winner of the tender for the fourth mobile operator is announced
