The Seaside Home for Children provided care and accommodation for up to six children aged between 12 and 16.
Ofsted inspectors said there were " serious and widespread failures " that meant children were not protected or their welfare was not promoted or safeguarded.
"The care and experiences of children and young people are poor and they are not making progress," they said.
Council leader Louise Goldsmith apologised for the disruption to the children and families affected, saying their welfare was paramount.
"Obviously I am disappointed by the report, but we accept the findings.
"We have taken the initiative and where we haven't been satisfied by the standards of care, we have taken the necessary and appropriate action.
"The children in West Sussex will always come first and we are now working hard to raise standards so that we have a consistently high level of care across the county," she said.
It has emerged that the lead member for children's services, councillor Stephen Hillier, has been removed from his post. Related Topic
