It's a Cardiff institution that is also Wales' longest running alternative club.
For several generations of music fans that have passed through its doors since it opened in August 1992, Metros has been a staple of nightlife in the Welsh capital
And for those who have taken to its dancefloor, it's certain they would have been led there thanks to resident DJ Hywel Ricketts.
This Friday, Hywel, 44, celebrates 25 years as resident DJ at the nightclub, situated on Bakers Row, in the city centre. Hywel in the DJ booth in the '90s Hywel at Metros in 2005
The club has had several incarnations throughout the decades including the Metropolitan, Monroes and one of Cardiff's first gay clubs The Tunnel Club.
Metros has firmly established itself as a city landmark, especially among the students who flock to the city every year. It's also cultivated something of a cult reputation as surely the only club in the UK where you're served free toast in the early hours of the morning.
While people move on, and musical fads and fashions have come and gone, the one constant has been Hywel, who started DJing at the club aged 19.
"After 25 years everything tends to fade into one big blur," says the DJ, who you can see doing his bit to get the dancefloor jumping on Wednesdays (Cheapskates) and Fridays (Havoc).
"I walked in the day it opened and gave the DJ at the time lots of hassle to give me a chance and let me play." Hywel (and friend) at Metros in 2001 Hywel at Metros in 1996
Although Hywel, who started out with his own mobile disco in his hometown of Penarth aged 14, recalls his very first taste of Djing at Metros didn't leave the best first impression.
"I remember it was a Thursday night and I bugged the DJ so much he said 'right you have a go then' and he went to the loo.
"The mobile disco set up I had was completely different to what was in the DJ booth. I'd never used cross faders in my life. The club was packed. There was 400 people there. I pressed play on Jesus Jones - Info Freako, there was silence. I was a rabbit in the headlights. The crowd was jeering. Luckily I quickly worked out what to do and the song kicked in.
"The next few months I did what you would call an old-fashioned apprenticeship and I had my first proper night here 25 years ago this week." The changing face of Metros nightclub in Cardiff 'The Metropolitan at Bakers Row'
He adds: "This was the era when great alternative clubs in the city like Subways, Bogiez, and The Square Club were open.
"It was a great scene. I was young and enthusiastic and all I ever wanted to do was play music. From that point on I fell in love with it. I fell in love with the music, and the people. When you look out from the DJ booth, and back then it was records, tape deck and CDs, nowadays it's a computer, you see a nightclub full of people laughing, singing, and jumping up and down. It's a buzz and I still get that same buzz today as I did way back in the early '90s."
Hywel reckons that what has kept the club going for so long is the team effort of the staff â€“ although he admitted that to some the club is 'Marmite'. Read More Brilliant footage from legendary Cardiff club night unearthed
"It's not just the music, it's a team effort - from the door man, to the bar staff to the managers, it's a big familly," he says. "Without them, there would be no club. Metros is not like any other club, it's got a massively unique quality it. Although it is like Marmite. You either love it to bits or it's the worst club ever. Luckily for us most people love it to bits.
"We keep ourselves to ourselves," he continued. "We don't get involved with any of the nightclub politics that can go on. We let them get on with it and we focus on what we do â€“ which is great music.
"It's a gathering of like-minded people and I feel lucky and honoured to be a part of it. The changing face of Metros nightclub in Cardiff
Throughout the decades Hywel has seen trends come and go as music fads have spun in and out of fashion. He's seen epochal moments like grunge, Britpop and Cool Cymru come and go, and is constantly aware that he has to keep things fresh to adapt with the times.
"I'm always listening to music," he said. "I wake up in the morning and I'm listening to playlists.
"The only difference between when I started out and now is the way is the way we consume music.
"I listen to stuff like Spotify playlists, but I'm flicking through radio stations, and I still get the promos from record companies.
"But I also listen to people who request new releases and seek their recommendations. If people come in and keep asking for a particular track, you know it's about to break.
"You've got to keep it fresh. You can't keep living on past glories. You've got to keep it updated and keep looking to the future."

In 25 years he's seen some sights â€“ many he says for legal reasons he can't repeat on the record.
"We've had streakers, Snow Patrol playing down here was a particularly memorable night and there was the time I had to rescue Kelly Jones from being mobbed.
"I remember it was a Saturday in the '90s, a night called Total Sound. Stereophonics had just been signed and one of the bar staff knew them all.
"They'd just played a local show and I don't think Kelly realised how big they had quickly become. He came down to the club and he was mobbed. I literally had to pick him up and throw him into the DJ booth until security was there so he had a bit of breathing room."

He's also, rather bizarrely, responsible for Boyzone turning up late for a matinee performance in the city.
"At the time there was a gentleman who half owned Metros who owned a restaurant. I went along and Boyzone were there having some food. I got introduced to them and was invited to their afterparty at (much-missed Cardiff club) The Emporium. They shut at 2am, so I opened up Metros for them and we rolled on until 8am in the morning. Boyzone were doing a matinee show in the city that afternoon and turned up on stage half hour late because they were so hungover."
While the DJ, who is also an active scout leader in Cardiff - a side of his life he readily admits is the perfect counterbalance to working in a nightclub - confesses there's been many highlights in his 25 year tenure at Metros, he talks with searing honesty about how the excesses of the city's nightlife scene drove him to the edge of destruction.

He reveals it was the birth of his son Edward, 10 years ago, which saved him.
"He's the greatest thing that has happened to me. Without him if I'd carried on the way I was I'd probably be dead by now.
"I enjoyed all aspects of working in a nightclub in the '90s. It was constant partying. I'd go out on a Friday and not come home until Tuesday. You're young, you feel invincible. Edward put my whole world into perspective and I immediately curtailed the excesses.
"Now my job is to put a roof over heads, food on the table and give him smiles, giggles and tickles. He's the perfect counterbalance to working in a nightclub." Read More World-renowned DJs and partying until the sun comes up - the colourful history of Wales' longest-running club night
The thousands who have passed through Metros doors through the decades have Hywel to thank for one of the most unorthodox promotional ruses ever dreamt up by any club â€“ one that has passed into the annals of legend.
You speak to anyone who has graced the club's dancefloor and they will inevitably grin and bark out the word 'toast!' It can surely be the only club in the UK where you're served free toast at 3am in the morning. Archive pics from Metros nightclub in Cardiff
And there appears to be quite the story behind its inception that fittingly enough begins at a Scouts fete sometime in the late '70s.
"It was the 5th Penarth Scouts summer fete," recalls Hywel. "There was a spin the wheel game. I didn't have any money so my friend's dad let me have a spin for free. I didn't win anything but he gave me a bar of soap. It seems silly looking back now but I just thought 'wow, I got something for free, amazing'.
"We were looking for ideas in the club and I remembered that time and I thought I wanted a promotion where we give something away that you don't have to sign up to, that doesn't have any catch or any gimmick. You've had a great night, so here you go have a piece of toast. Read More Incredible images of U2 and Depeche Mode at a tiny Cardiff club have been discovered
"It started in the mid-90s and it just caught. It's still going on. Every night of the week that we are open there's free toast.
"It usually happens towards the end of the night around 2am-3am when the club is winding down," he adds. "It comes in handy for some people who need a bit of food, but it's just giving something back for free.
"Sometimes you get through three or four loaves. One night we had a guy turned up with a tin of baked beans. Luckily we had a microwave so we we cooked his baked beans for him. He was the happiest man I had seen in a long while." Metros - 2018 Read More These amazing pictures from '80s alternative clubs, pubs and bars in Cardiff have recently been unearthed
It's that quirkiness, that independently minded approach that defines Metros. It might not be everybody's cup of tea but for those who love it, they absolutely revere it.
"It's a place of love," says Hywel. "People genuinely love coming down here. The regulars will come three times a week. People always talk with a smile about the place. It's an institution that has its weathered so many music storms and has maintained its popularity.
"If you were a student in Cardiff at some point you would have popped into Metros. If you like alternative music you would have popped into Metros and had a beer. I sometimes wonder how many solicitors, doctors, and barristers have walked through those doors as an undergraduate fresh to Cardiff."

You can never predict what the future may bring, but Hywel says he would still love to be DJing at Metros in another 25 years' time.
"I would love to. There's no reason not to be. The only reason is if your numbers dropped. If you're still pulling people in you've still got a job. If all of a sudden nobody likes what you're doing and there's nobody coming in, it's time for a change. That's why you've always got to keep up with what's going on now, but I'd still love to be doing this in another 25 years' time."
