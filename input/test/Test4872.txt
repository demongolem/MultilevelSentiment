These systems are generally employed for assisting industrial customers at the time of plant start-up & maintenance outages, as well as during emergency drinking water shortages at residential buildings. Growing demand for industrial and potable water worldwide has made huge capital investments, logistics and technological innovations to be most considered factors among vendors.Culligan International Co.'s division of water treatment for industrial and commercial applications, Culligan Matrix Solutions, is now expanding its business of mobile water treatment systems, in response to surging demand for water. Culligan's mobile water treatment system offers a multi-level, exhaustive water purification, control, and monitoring. This modular system has been designed for accommodating a wide array of feed sources including seawater, surface water, and brackish water. Capable of operating in rugged environment, Culligan's mobile water treatment systems facilitate quick installation for providing large amount of water on demand.Research Efforts for Revolutionizing Water Treatment to Influence Growth of Mobile Water Treatment Systems MarketA research effort, funded federally, to revolutionize the water treatment process has yielded direct solar desalination technology, which leverages energy from sunlight for heating salt water for membrane distillation. An emerging water desalination technology is membrane distillation, wherein hot salt water is passed through a porous membrane while cold freshwater is passed through the other. Water vapor is then naturally drawn via the membrane from hot side to the cold side. However, energy costs are high in this process on account of heat loss from the membrane's hot side to the cold side.The desalination system developed by NEWT â€“ Center for Nanotechnology Enabled Water Treatment, is the first major innovation which utilizes the combination of light-harvesting nanophotonoics and membrane distillation technology. This innovation, called "NESMD - nanophotonoics-enabled solar membrane distillation", is unlike any other being employed currently across the globe. Such innovations, with minimal pumping energy requirements, are expected to affect growth of the global market for mobile water treatment systems in the near future.GalMobile â€“ Solving Water WoesBenjamin Netanyahu - Israeli Prime Minister demonstrated an amazing technology to the Indian Prime Minister â€“ Narendra Modi in 2017. The technology, called "GalMobile", is a sea-water purifying machine at mobile desalination plant. An independent and integrated water purification system, GalMobile produces high-quality drinking water, and is highly beneficial in times of natural disasters such as earthquakes, floods, and in rural areas where drinking water supply is low. India has been seeking cooperation with Israel for its water management and recycling processes, as Israel is renowned for the expertise in these fields.To know more about the Mobile Water Treatment Systems Market, Visit the link @ www.factmr.com/report/667/mobile-water-treatment-systems-... On July 5, 2017, the Ministry of Drinking Water and Sanitation of India signed memorandum of understanding (MoU) with the Ministry of National Infrastructure, Energy and Water Resources of Israel regarding a national water reservation campaign in India. As groundwater is considered to be a less sustainable source, emphasis on improving wastewater treatment and desalination has been increasing in India, and technologies such as GalMobile can be of high benefit, provided with large parts of the country's borders lined to oceans and seas.This report covers a holistic scope of mobile water treatment systems as a product in the healthcare industry.
