Manchester City expect Kevin De Bruyne to return from his knee injury within three months after the Belgium midfielder travelled to Barcelona on Thursday for treatment.
After sustaining the injury in training on Wednesday, De Bruyne appeared at the premiere of All or Nothing, a documentary about last season's champions to be aired on Amazon Prime, on crutches and with his right knee in a brace. The 27-year-old flew to see renowned doctor Ramon Cugat the following morning, with further tests revealing that he does not require surgery on his damaged lateral ligament.

A statement from City on Friday confirmed that De Bruyne suffered a lateral collateral ligament (LCL) lesion in his right knee. "No surgery is required, and the midfielder is expected to be out for around three months," read the statement.
However, it is understood that the club remains hopeful he could be back in action sooner, meaning De Bruyne â€“ who was voted as City's player of the season as they won the title with a record number of points â€“ would return before the end of October. That would see him miss crucial fixtures against Liverpool, Tottenham and Manchester United, as well as the first two rounds of fixtures in the Champions League
