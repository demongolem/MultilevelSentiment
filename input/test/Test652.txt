Inc. magazine today revealed that TitleSmart, Inc., a leading Twin Cities title insurance company, has been named on its 37th annual Inc. 5000, the most prestigious ranking of the nation's fastest-growing private companies. The list represents a unique look at the most successful companies within the American economy's most dynamic segmentâ€”its independent small businesses. Microsoft, Dell, Domino's Pizza, Pandora, Timberland, LinkedIn, Yelp, Zillow, and many other well-known names gained their first national exposure as honorees on the Inc. 5000. This is the fifth consecutive year TitleSmart, Inc. has been named on the Inc. 5000. "Being ranked on the Inc. 5000 list for a fifth consecutive year is incredible!" said Cindy Koebele, President of TitleSmart, Inc. "This huge accomplishment could not have been achieved without the hard work and dedication of our staff. Their loyalty and commitment to excellence has allowed us to continue this high level of growth year after year."
Not only have the companies on the 2018 Inc. 5000 been very competitive within their markets, but the list as a whole shows staggering growth compared with prior lists. The 2018 Inc. 5000 achieved an astounding three-year average growth of 538.2 percent, and a median rate of 171.8 percent. The Inc. 5000's aggregate revenue was $206.1 billion in 2017, accounting for 664,095 jobs over the past three years.

"This is your 5th time on the Inc. 5000, which is a truly extraordinary accomplishment," states James Ledbetter, Editor in Chief of Inc. Media. "Needless to say, making the list gets harder every year as your starting base grows. Of the tens of thousands of companies that have applied to the Inc. 5000 over the years, a mere one in ten have made the list 5 times."
