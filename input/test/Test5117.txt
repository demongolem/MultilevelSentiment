Orbis Research - Friday, August 17, 2018. This report studies the Motorcycle Engine Control Unit (ECU) market, Motorcycle Engine Control Unit (ECU), also commonly called an engine control unit (ECU), is a type of electronic control unit that controls a series of actuators on an internal combustion engine to ensure optimal engine performance. It does this by reading values from a multitude of sensors within the engine bay, interpreting the data using multidimensional performance maps (called lookup tables), and adjusting the engine actuators accordingly. At present, in the foreign industrial developed countries the Motorcycle Engine Control Unit industry is generally at a more advanced level, the world's large enterprises are mainly concentrated in the United States, Europe, Japan, etc. Meanwhile, foreign companies have more advanced equipment, strong R & D capability, the technical level is in a leading position. But foreign companies' manufacturing cost is relatively high, compared with Chinese companies, the manufacturing cost is competitive disadvantage, as the Chinese Motorcycle Engine Control Unit production enterprise technology continues to improve, their share in the international market is increasing, competitiveness in the international market gradually increase . Chinese Motorcycle Engine Control Unit industry has developed into a national industry with certain research and production capacity, industry product mix has gradually improved, currently China has become international Motorcycle Engine Control Unit large consumption country, but the production technology is relatively laggard, currently can only produce some low-end product, although after 2012 the new production lines is increasing, the technology is still relying on import. With the rapid growth of the national economy as well as the rapid development of downstream industries, Chinese motorcycle market demand is exuberant, providing a good opportunity for the development of Motorcycle Engine Control Unit market and technology. Over the next five years, LPI(LP Information) projects that Motorcycle Engine Control Unit (ECU) will register a -2.1% CAGR in terms of revenue, reach US$ 1750 million by 2023, from US$ 1980 million in 2017.
