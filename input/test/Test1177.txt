Poor diet in early pregnancy can increase the risk of your unborn child contracting schizophrenia.
Research reveals babies born to mums who eat badly before and during pregnancy are at risk from a whole host of dangerous ailments in adulthood, including diabetes and cardiovascular disease.
Neuroscientist Dr Sandrine Willaime-Morawek, an associate professor in stem cells and neurobiology at the University of Southampton , explained that a link has also been established between low protein levels in a mother's diet and memory problems in their offspring.
She said: "From research conducted on young women, we already know what you eat before getting pregnant and at the beginning of the pregnancy (before finding out you're pregnant) is important to lower the risks of your baby getting diseases in later life, such as cardiovascular disease and diabetes, and also neurological diseases like schizophrenia Read More Scots woman with crippling 'stiff person syndrome' in desperate treatment bid after NHS snub
"We showed recently, using a mouse model, that poor protein in a mother's diet in early pregnancy, around the time of conception, can have a lasting effect on brain development.
"Our study is the first to demonstrate clearly that poor maternal nutrition during the first days of pregnancy, known as the pre-implantation period, can have adverse effects on early brain development and long-lasting consequences in adults."
The study shows that a maternal diet low in protein during this critical period reduces the production of neural stem cells, the cells that make our nerve cells in the brain, leading to errors in the timing and number of nerve cells formed - and ultimately resulting in poor memory in the adult.
Professor Willaime-Morawek added: "Previous studies have shown protein reduction in the diet during pregnancy and breastfeeding can damage the brain of the baby, leading to lasting effects for coordination and cognitive function.
"However, the importance of nutrition at the very start of pregnancy for brain development has been unknown, until now.

"We also show the pre-implantation period is key in determining adult physical characteristics.
"Significant effects were found with only a mild nutritional challenge - half of the recommended protein amount - highlighting the significance of this period for adult health.
"It does make a difference what you eat before finding out you're pregnant, to decrease the risks of your baby getting diseases later in life.
"Very subtle differences in the mother's nutrition around the time of conception can have detrimental long-term consequences for the health of the child. A healthy and balanced diet before, during and after pregnancy will help your baby grow and develop optimally."P Like us on Faceboo
