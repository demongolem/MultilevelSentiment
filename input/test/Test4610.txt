16.08.2018 - 11h40 Ten FIA World Champions competing at 6 Hours of Silverstone Round 3 of the 2018/19 FIA World Endurance Championship will be held at the home of British motor sport, Silverstone, and there are no fewer than 10 world champions on the entry list. Round 3 of the 2018/19 FIA World Endurance Championship will be held at the home of British motor sport, Silverstone. The grid for the 6 Hours of Silverstone on Sunday 19 August will boast no less than ten past or reigning FIA World Champions from three different disciplines. All eyes of the British fans will be on 2009 F1 World Champion Jenson Button as he competes in his second endurance race for the SMP Racing team in the LMP1 category. The 38-year-old didn't finish the 24 Hours of Le Mans in June when the BR Engineering BR1-AER retired late in the race, so Button will be hoping for better luck in front of his home fans. Double F1 title holder Fernando Alonso travels to Silverstone as a 24 Hours of Le Mans race winner after he and fellow Toyota drivers Sebastien Buemi and Kazuki Nakajima crossed the finish line to secure a famous win. The trio also took victory at Spa-Francorchamps in May to travel to Silverstone will maximum points from the first two races and a healthy 20 point lead in the championship. There are two multiple World Touring Car Champions with Jose Maria Lopez competing in the no7 Toyota Gazoo Racing TS050 alongside Britain's Mike Conway and Japan's Kamui Kobayashi. Andy Priaulx will be racing alongside fellow Brit Harry Tincknell in the Ford GT run by UK based Ford Chip Ganassi Team UK in the LMGTE Pro category. There are four former FIA World Endurance Drivers' Champions with Andre Lotterer (2012) racing in the no1 Rebellion Racing, Sebastien Buemi (2014) the current championship leader in the no8 Toyota Gazoo Racing TS050, Loic Duval (2013) racing the no23 TDS Racing Oreca 07-Gibson in the LMP2 category and Anthony Davidson (2014) who returns to the WEC in the no31 Oreca-Gibson, also in the LMP2 class. Reigning FIA World Endurance GT Champions James Calado and Alessandro Pier Guidi will also be on the grid for the 6 Hours of Silverstone in their AF Corse run Ferrari F488 GTE EVO competing for the Italian manufacturer against entries from Aston Martin, BMW, Ford and Porsche.
