There is a lot of hard work that goes into delivering hit after hit, and year after year too. Occasionally, they need a minute or two just to channel their creativenessâ€¦ a recharge period if you will. Without doubt, this can leave fans disappointed, but these breathers are wholly worth the wait, especially when they come back with a hit! One of the few who have succeeded in this is the songstress and performer Adora Kisting. Admired for her Afro pop, Damara Punch as well as Afro house; Kisting made a comeback recently with her song 'Akutiike Kwi'. Having no new material since 2016 with her debut album 'As I Am'; the singer is still celebrating the success the album brought. The last time tjil spoke to her, Kisting was in the middle of touring which she says went exceptionally well and allowed her to connect more with her fans. She says trying to keep the momentum without releasing new material has been somewhat a challenge and a learning curve. According to her, more love came pouring in when she was nominated and won the Most Disciplined Artist of the Year at the NAMAs 2017."Sometimes you have to readjust to make sure you fit in with the mainstream which I really enjoyed. I appreciate things that allow me to move out of my comfort zone. I also realised that the audience really pays attention to everything I do. They pick up the tiniest things and I like that because I too pay attention to details," she said.Speaking on many challenges within the industry, including entertainers not being able to swallow the criticism pill, Kisting begs to differ and instead said she appreciates it. According to her, both negative and positive criticism only makes her a better artist and has taught her to be optimistic. She takes the negative critics lightly because she is in no competition with any other artist and that; she says this is the beauty of one being in their own lane. "This means I should get worried only I don't move up my own ladder and not the industry as a whole," Kisting said.The artist, who is glad to be back on the scene, says her latest single was inspired by her friends and this is a way of connecting with her Oshiwambo fans. The song 'Akutiike Kwi', which when loosely translated means something is going somewhere, is definitely a certified summer hit. The song also has educational aspects as it is meant to unite and condemn tribalism. The music video was released a week ago on YouTube and has received overwhelmingly positive feedback. "Two years is a long time and I'm just glad it's finally out. We tried a new element which is to give each song on the album its fair chance to live, we shoot videos here and there and that's what I have been doing in for the past two years. It doesn't mean one must release an album every year and this worked in my favour because the fans got to appreciate each song," she said.June Shimuoshil
