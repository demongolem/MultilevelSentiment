At this point of the season, it's not uncommon for footballers to be carrying some form of injury. The more fortunate will still be sore and tired due to the weekly grind of the game. Others might be nursing sore joints and limbs that need a jab to get onto the field. In Rory Lobb's case he's carrying a crack in his spine.
"We haven't had a scan but it might be still there, it'd still be healing," Lobb told Fairfax Media. "It feels fine."
A lot on his back: Giants stand-in ruckman Rory Lobb is still recovering from a fracture in his back.

"I was pretty flat when it happened. They said it would be six, I wasn't too happy," Lobb said.
"It started recovering pretty well in the first week. By the time I hit the second week I started to feel pretty good. I started progressing at training, pulling up well, we thought we'd take the risk and bring me back. It seems to have paid off."

Loading "It was roll the dice, we had to get the season going," Lobb said. "[It was] a bit shaky at the start but feels good now."
At first, Lobb wore padding at training to build his confidence but took it off once he felt reassured.
"You try not to think about it and play the game," Lobb said.
It clearly takes a lot to daunt the 25-year-old West Australian, which is just as well because when it comes to challenges there's none bigger than what is now confronting him.
For the second year in a row, Lobb will need to step up to take the No.1 ruck mantle for the Giants in the finals. Last year, he took over from Shane Mumford, now he is replacing Dawson Simpson, whose season was ended by an ankle injury.
Despite being earmarked as the Giants' long-term ruckman, it has not been his primary position for most of his 70 games. In his third game, he made headlines for the wrong reasons when North Melbourne's Todd Goldstein set a record for most hit outs in a game.
"I wasn't actually meant to be playing ruck that game," Lobb said with a laugh. "Andrew Phillips was a late withdrawal. I was definitely thrown into the deep end in my third game.
Learning curve: Todd Goldstein posted the record number of hit outs against Rory Lobb in 2015.

He had the chance to make the spot his own this year but hyper-extended his knee in the last Sydney derby, missing four games with bone bruising. It could easily have been a lot worse.
While he was out the Giants experimented with the position. They were undecided if they wanted to play a specialist in Simpson or a big forward who could ruck, like Jonathon Patton and Lachlan Keeffe. When he returned, the Giants had locked in on Simpson.
Lobb is still not sure which position he is better suited to but it's clear it is the ruck where the Giants need him most now.
"I'm learning my craft in the ruck at the moment," Lobb said. "It's game to game, just learning as much as I can."
Lobb's performance against Adelaide bodes well for the Giants' flag hopes as he showed he could not only match it with one of the game's leading ruckmen but beat him. The big test comes next week against likely All Australian Max Gawn.
At a towering 207cm, Lobb, with his long arms, appears tailor-made for the role, but it's as a forward where he has played his best football. He's made his name with his ability to take big marks but it's his comical goalkicking technique that is more likely to stick in the minds of the casual viewer.
Like West Coast's goalkicking machine Josh Kennedy, Lobb gets an attack of the stutters as he lines up for goal. It's as if he has broken into an impersonation of Fred Flinstone.
It doesn't appear to be conducive to straight kicking but, like Kennedy, has not affected his accuracy. The habit developed in his second year as a way of slowing himself down in his approach so he did not get too close to the man on the mark.
"I started stuttering and eventually it came into my routine," Lobb said. "I got rid of it for a little bit and it gradually crept back in."
Lobb believes he now has it under control though he has not had any set shots in games to truly test it out.
"I put a mark on the ground now [at training] and make sure I'm kicking when I get to that mark," Lobb said. "I take a lot less steps now, it's not on my mind. I take what I need to kick and go from there. With the way I have it set up now there's a lot less steps so it should work out a lot better.
