LTL Mandarin School have launched a new website based here - [login to view URL]
We have a number of other language websites we want to create. Currently we have completed Russian and Italian and we are now searching for native speakers to come forward and help us develop our brand worldwide. We are after a native speaker of any language who is skilled in keyword research, structuring a website and writing the content.
NOTE THE LANGUAGES WE ALREADY HAVE FILLED FOR - Arabic, Portuguese, Spanish, Russian, Dutch, Italian
The core tasks will be:
1 - Research our current website - livethelanguage.cn. Get a feel for how it works, the content, the structure, the keywords and so forth.
2 - After researching we need you to build the navigation structure in your native language. This may not be directly translated from English to the given language. Some terms are searched in English that are not in your language and vice versa. You must create a structure that will appeal to our market in your given language, which will require research.
3 - Conduct keyword research on the core pages. Primary, secondary and tertiary keywords.
4 - Having completed the website structure and keyword research you are now in a place to write the content. This should not be translated from our current website but written from scratch. Use the current website to give you an idea of our brand, then write from the start.
5 - You will work with our Marketing Manager who will assist you. Upon completing the content we will put the website live via a new domain which we will discuss with you.
This is a fairly lengthy process but must be done with utmost precision. We would rather quality over a longer period of time than a quick solution that doesn't fit.
After completion there will be room to discuss future, ongoing work if we are satisfied and you'd like to continue working with us
