, which can also lead to dementia, were excluded from the study.<br />Read More<br />"The most novel result is the large contribution of alcohol-use disorders to the burden of dementia over the lifespan," said Dr. Michael Schwarzinger, a researcher at the Transitional Health Economics Network in Paris and a leading author of the study.<br />The association was particularly strong for those with early-onset dementia, diagnosed when the patient is younger than 65. Over half of the individuals in the early-onset group had alcohol-related dementia or an additional diagnosis of alcohol-use disorder.<br />"Given the strength of the association, what is the most surprising to me is that alcohol-use disorders had received so little interest in dementia research and public health policies," Schwarzinger said.<br />How alcohol might damage the brain<br />Although many studies have shown a strong association between excessive alcohol use and dementia, this study is unique in its findings about early-onset dementia, according to Dr. Kostas Lyketsos, a neuropsychiatry professor and director of the<br />who was not involved in the study.<br />"That is rather unique," Lyketsos said. "It does remind us that alcoholics have shorter life expectancies."<br />The study was also among the largest of its kind. But, according to Lyketsos, the large size could leave the study open to selection bias.<br />"There's a tradeoff between size and precision of the variables," he said. "The more people you have, the less confidence you have in the elements that go into the diagnosis of dementia.<br />"I also want to point out that this was really a sample of hospitalized individuals. It's very unusual for people with dementia, at least in the milder stages, to be hospitalized," he added.<br />Lower-class drinkers face worse heart health risks, study says<br />Research<br />suggests multiple ways heavy alcohol use can lead to dementia. First, ethanol and its byproduct acetaldehyde are known to have a toxic effect on the brain that can lead to long-term structural and functional brain damage, Schwarzinger says.<br />Heavy alcohol use can also lead to a condition called hepatic encephalopathy, characterized by a loss in brain function due to increases of ammonia in the blood caused by liver damage.<br />"Heavy drinking is also strongly associated with vascular risk factors such as high blood pressure or diabetes mellitus as well as cardiovascular diseases," Schwarzinger added.<br />"Lastly, heavy drinking clusters (in) people with less education, smoking habits, and/or depression. All of these factors were found to be independent risk factors for dementia onset."<br />Though heavy alcohol use increased the risk of dementia in general, the association was shown to be stronger in men.<br />When other factors were not controlled for, heavy drinking was associated with a higher risk of dementia among both men and women. In men, the risk was increased by a factor of 4.7, while in women, it increased by a factor of 4.3.<br />But even when the researchers controlled for factors like high blood pressure, obesity and tobacco smoking, heavy alcohol use was still associated with a more than threefold increase in dementia among both sexes.<br />Results differed by sex<br />The study also showed that the average age of dementia onset differed between men and women. Men were more likely to develop it a younger age and women at an older age.<br />Why it&#39;s so hard to treat dementia<br />"Gender differences on dementia onset have been puzzling for decades," Schwarzinger said. "Men have a poorer lifestyle than women on average, in particular heavier alcohol consumption. Therefore, it is somewhat unsurprising that early-onset dementia identifies a cluster of men with alcohol use disorders."<br />The gender difference could also result from the study's methodology, according to Lyketsos.<br />"That was one of the reasons I'm a little concerned about selection bias," he said. "There could be a gender effect on who goes to the hospital with dementia."<br />Alcohol use was also not objectively measured in the participants, one of the study's main limitations.<br />"We have no idea what is the level of drinks they were actually drinking," Schwarzinger added. "That kind of information you can only get in a cohort study with a questionnaire."<br />Follow CNN Health on Facebook and Twitter<br />See the latest news and share your comments with CNN Health on<br /
