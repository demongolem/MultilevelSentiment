A recent LifeWay Research study reported on the invite habits of American churchgoers. Today, we examine the results and discuss how to correct the problems.
Some highlights from today's episode include: Nearly two-thirds of Protestant churchgoers have invited someone to church in the last six months. Regular church attenders are more likely to invite others to join them than sporadic attenders. Pastors need to create an awareness and an atmosphere of inviting in their church. People will likely accept your invitation to church if you already have a relationship with them and offer to walk in/arrive with them.
