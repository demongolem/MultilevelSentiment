ramped up its tariff threats<br />.<br />China has expressed frustration that the United States has not established a clear point person in the negotiations, which have been led by an alternating group of officials including Steven Mnuchin, the Treasury secretary; Robert E. Lighthizer, the United States trade representative; Mr. Ross; and others. This week, the Treasury Department designated David Malpass, the under secretary for international affairs, to lead the discussions.<br />While the Trump administration has outlined its broad priorities, the specifics of its demands remain murky and China continues to meet every new tariff threat with its own promise of retaliation.<br />â€œIâ€™m not particularly optimistic that weâ€™re going to see a deal anytime soon,â€� said David Loevinger, the Treasury Departmentâ€™s senior coordinator for China from 2009 to 2012. â€œItâ€™s still kind of unclear what it would take for the U.S. to get to yes on a trade deal.â€�<br />Also unclear is whether the tariffs and investment restrictions have done much to persuade China to make further concessions on trade, beyond its offers this year to purchase American goods and open up some markets to more foreign competition. Some Chinese officials now appear to suspect that Mr. Trumpâ€™s trade plans are part of a broader effort aimed at thwarting Chinaâ€™s rise, and that any concessions would do little to prevent what looks like an intensifying struggle for global dominance between the countries.<br />At<br />a campaign rally in West Virginia<br />on Tuesday, Mr. Trump lauded his success in slowing Chinaâ€™s rise.<br />â€œWhen I came, we were heading in a certain direction that was going to allow China to be bigger than us in a very short period of time,â€� Mr. Trump said. â€œThatâ€™s not going to happen anymore.â€�<br />Still, there is hope on both sides that the current talks can serve as a steppingstone to more significant negotiations this year. Mr. Trump is expected to meet with President Xi Jinping of China at the Group of 20 summit meeting in Argentina in November.<br />â€œI donâ€™t see any breakthroughs unless the Chinese bring something completely unexpected, which seems unlikely, but these talks could be useful in setting expectations by identifying what areas are fruitful for further discussion and what ideas are nonstarters,â€� said Christopher Adams, who had been the senior coordinator for China affairs at the Treasury Department before leaving this year.<br />On Thursday, the president seemed content to promote his tough trade record as he met with Republican senators including John Cornyn of Texas, Tom Cotton of Arkansas, Mike Crapo of Idaho and Marco Rubio of Florida.<br />The president praised the lawmakers for passing legislation this month that would strengthen the review of foreign deals in America by an interagency group known as the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States. He also highlighted his own tariffs on China, which he said were bringing a â€œtremendous amount of moneyâ€� into government coffers.<br />â€œThey wonâ€™t be stealing our companies anymore, especially companies that are quite complex,â€� Mr. Trump said. â€œWe will protect Americaâ€™s crown jewels of intellectual property and advanced technologies from harmful foreign investments.â€�<br />The new investment rules, which must be put in place in the next 18 months, will allow the committee to look at a wider range of purchases, including real estate deals and those in which foreigners do not take a controlling stake of a company. The government has already started hiring new officials for those posts, a senior administration official said in a briefing call about the legislation on Thursday morning.<br />Chinese investment in the United States<br />fell sharply in the first half of the year<br />, both in anticipation of the expansion of the committeeâ€™s oversight and as a result of tighter controls within China on outbound investment.<br />The senior administration official added that the United States was open to engaging with China, and emphasized that Beijing must address â€œthe fundamental concerns we have raisedâ€� over their trade practices. â€œWe havenâ€™t seen that yet,â€� he said.<br />Get politics and Washington news updates via<br /
