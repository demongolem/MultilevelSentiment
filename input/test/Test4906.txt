MINNEAPOLIS (AP) - A Willmar man accused of illegally possessing a large cache of weapons has pleaded guilty in federal court.
Forty-six-year-old Chad Monson was arrested during a Jan. 30 raid of his rural Kandiyohi County home by drug and gang task force agents.
A federal grand jury in June indicted him on numerous firearms violations related to an arsenal of machine guns, ammunition, silencers and pipe bombs.
The U.S. attorney's office says Willmar pleaded guilty on Thursday. A sentencing date wasn't immediately set.
