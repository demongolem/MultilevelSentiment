Gatsby is a static site generator for React and allows web developers to create a static HTML file. Thus it provides fast initial load times and makes dealing with SEO much simpler. The user-side experience is very comfortable when JavaScript is enabled, and you don't lose any content or navigation while having disabled JavaScript. By adding a single plugin, Gatsby can provide offline support as well, transforming your site into a Progressive Web Application.
The Purpose and Background of GatsbyJS Gatsby allows web developers to create static HTML files for every single page . Right after loading the page, Gatsby will boot up React and enable the user to navigate through the website just like a single page app.
It also supports web developers in using external sources such as Drupal CMS, Contentful, WordPress, as well as Stripe, Trello, Medium, MongoDB, and many others. If the data you require can be accessed via an API, you can write a Gatsby source plugin to consume it as well. All these assets can be used simultaneously.
"Gatsby can collate data from multiple sources which can then be queried by our templates. This is a significant difference when compared to most static site generators. Instead of only using Markdown files, I can now use any number of different data files locally," explains Ray Gesualdo .
Gatsby is a perfect solution for the developers that just started using React , but it also is a suitable tool for small and medium businesses, startups and self-employed professionals with limited budgets. Using Gatsby doesn't require a high-level experience with JS.

Another value of this static site generator is its simplicity . Modern JavaScript websites are too complex to rely only on web developers always configuring things correctly. Gatsby simplifies website development by extracting configuration out of your site and moving it into the framework and community plugins. As a static site generator, Gatsby allows web developers with relatively little experience to create React-like apps. Currently, many developers use Gatsby to learn React.
