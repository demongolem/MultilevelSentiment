launched in 2016<br />, is Amazon&#8217;s answer to the rise of Digital Ocean, OVH and other affordable virtual private server (VPS) players. Lightsail started as a pretty basic service, but over the course of the last two years, AWS added features like block storage, Windows support and additional regions.<br />Today, the company<br />announced<br />it is launching two new instance sizes and cutting in half the price of most Linux-based Lightsail instances. Windows instances are also getting cheaper, though the price cut there is closer to 30 percent for most instances.<br />The only Linux instance that isn&#8217;t getting a full 50 percent cut is the $5/month 512 MB instance, which will now cost $3.50. That&#8217;s not too bad, either. Depending on your needs, 512 MB can be enough to run a few projects, so if you don&#8217;t need a full 1 GB, you can save a few dollars by going with Lightsail over Digital Ocean&#8217;s smallest $5/month 1 GB instance. Indeed, it&#8217;s probably no surprise that Lightsail&#8217;s 1 GB instance now also costs $5/month.<br />All instance types come with attached SSD storage, SSH access, a static IP address and all of the other features you&#8217;d expect from a VPS hosting service.<br />As usual, Windows instances cost a bit more (those Windows licenses aren&#8217;t free, after all) and now start at $8 per month for a 512 MB instances. The more usable 1 GB instance will set you back $12 per month.<br />As for the new instance sizes, the new 16 GB instance will feature 4 vCPUs, 320 GB of storage and a generous 6 TB of data transfer. The 32 GB instance doubles the vCPU and storage numbers and offers 7 TB of data transfer.<br />&nbsp;<br /
