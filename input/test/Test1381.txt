granted immunity in the case.<br />Read More<br />"I know all about flipping, 30, 40 years I have been watching flippers," Trump told "Fox &amp; Friends" in an interview that aired Thursday, before the Pecker news broke, as he reflected on the Cohen episode, which leaves him dangerously exposed. "Everything is wonderful, and then they get 10 years in jail and they flip on whoever the next highest one is or as high as you can go."<br />In a new sign of peril for the President, The Associated Press<br />reported<br />that a safe at the Enquirer, known for "catch and kill" deals to stifle celebrity scandals, contained documentation on potentially damaging stories about Trump.<br />Recent events make clear that some who served Trump no longer fear his contempt, or are putting themselves first when forced to choose between their fidelity to him and their own political and constitutional duties or legal exposure.<br />That is a worrying proposition for a President who was implicated in a crime this week, who is embroiled in potentially the most serious criminal investigation of a commander in chief in decades and -- if a 1 a.m. tweet from the White House on Thursday lambasting the "Witch Hunt" is any guide -- is increasingly consumed by his own fate.<br />NO COLLUSION - RIGGED WITCH HUNT!<br />&mdash; Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump)<br />August 23, 2018<br />Trump has been underestimated many times in ways that have fueled his political rise and stunningly unorthodox presidency, so it's possible he can ride out this rough patch.<br />But any sense that he's no longer quite the omnipotent operator he was will embolden his enemies and, if the midterm elections go badly, may eventually weigh on the calculations of his GOP protectors in Washington, a town with a feral instinct for weakness.<br />The cycle of betrayals must be especially galling for a President who craves loyalty and genuflection -- but it's perhaps inevitable given he has often failed to show loyalty to those around him. His fraying protective shield is likely to bind him ever more closely to longtime aides who have yet to blink -- often at considerable cost to their own reputations -- as well as to his blood relatives and adoring political base.<br />Every President comes to learn the loneliness of ultimate power. But the burden is more acute if he is always wondering who will betray him next.<br />Loyalty, above all<br />Trump, a tycoon with a tabloid past, has always had a huge circle of acquaintances but a tight inner circle in which family and trust are paramount.<br />But it became clear as he transitioned to politics that his need for loyalty -- exemplified by accounts of encounters with the President<br />by fired FBI Director James Comey --<br />raged within him, and often flowed one way.<br />His administration has featured awkward televised sessions in which he has required Republican lawmakers or Cabinet secretaries to pledge allegiance.<br />Subordinates who absorbed bitter criticism to work for him -- like former chief of staff Reince Priebus or ex-press secretary Sean Spicer -- found loyalty in short supply from the President when he tired of them.<br />No Trump cabinet member has been more poorly treated than Sessions, the first senator to back his campaign.<br />Trump is disgusted that Sessions disqualified himself from oversight of the Russia investigation, seeing it as a betrayal from someone he believes should be loyal to him rather the traditions of the Justice Department and his constitutional duties.<br />"He took the job and then he said, 'I'm going to recuse myself' -- I said what kind of a man is this? By the way, he was on the campaign. The only reason I gave him the job, I felt loyalty," Trump told Fox.<br />Once, Sessions might have kept quiet. But on<br />Thursday he hit back,<br />showing where his loyalties now rest.<br />"While I am Attorney General, the actions of the Department of Justice will not be improperly influenced by political considerations," Sessions said, in a clear swipe at a President who has repeatedly assaulted the integrity and the independence of the Justice Department.<br />"I demand the highest standards, and where they are not met, I take action. However, no nation has a more talented, more dedicated group of law enforcement investigators and prosecutors than the United States," Sessions said.<br />Trump and Sessions have been on the rocks for months. But the President's relationships with two other former acolytes, Cohen and Omarosa Manigault Newman -- the former "Apprentice" contestant and White House aide -- flamed out more suddenly.<br />Cohen felt spurned by<br />Trump after an FBI raid earlier this year<br />that led to him pleading guilty to bank and tax fraud and campaign violations on Tuesday.<br />And in a spectacular display of turning loyalties to royalties, Manigault Newman, who said she became more and more disillusioned with Trump over race issues, published a tell-all book, "Unhinged," and is<br />spilling tapes and videos<br />of her time in the administration.<br />The President's son Eric made no secret of his contempt for her behavior when he tweeted on Aug. 16: "I truly hate disloyal people." The President lashed out at his former "Apprentice" colleague, calling her a "dog" on Twitter.<br />I truly hate disloyal people<br />&mdash; Eric Trump (@EricTrump)<br />August 17, 2018<br />Trump : Cohen only a 'part time' partnership<br />While scorning Cohen, Trump is also minimizing his relationship with him, which -- given the possibility that his former lawyer could cooperate with Mueller -- is now a glaring vulnerability.<br />"He worked for me, you could say more or less part time," Trump told Fox.<br />That characterization of their relationship is misleading, said David Cay Johnston, author of "It's Even Worse Than You Think," a book about the Trump administration's impact on America.<br />"For 10 years, this was the guy who handled the most sensitive things Donald had to hide. That's why he is the lawyer on the (Karen) McDougal and the Stormy Daniels hush money payments," Johnston told CNN's Ana Cabrera.<br />"Donald knew he could trust him to do his dirty work and to conceal what he really is like from the public."<br /
