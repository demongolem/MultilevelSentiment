Reblog JP Dutta adds another war film to his oeuvre after 12 years - Paltan. The solidly committed soldiers in the posters are played by Arjun Rampal, Sonu Sood, Gurmeet Chowdhary, Luv Sinha and Harshvardhan Rane. The film also stars Jackie Shroff. Paltan is based on the 1967 Sino-Indian War (between India and China). By the look of it, it will be a quintessential Dutta film: intense, action-packed and with nationalistic overtones. The makers spent a year researching the film. Lieutenant Attar Singh, Major Bishan Singh and the family of Captain Dagar (the real war hero who was a part of the war in 1967) helped the makers to recreate the sets in Ladakh. The war heroes who helped Dutta recreate the sets of Paltan. More ""I meet all the officers with the help of their respective battalions. The commanding officer of the battalion gives me the contact and then I start my research. Attar Singh came on our sets and he pointed out and zeroed in on the feature that was closest to Nathula. I start with getting in touch with the heroes and their families and then I start getting my facts right and keep it as real as I possibly can for cinema."" - JP Dutta Billed as India's biggest war trilogy, the film is based on the Nathu La military clashes of 1967 which took place along the Sikkim border. The film slated to release on 7 September
