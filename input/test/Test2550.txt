Nigeria's Falconets have been eliminated from the ongoing 2018 FIFA U-20 Women's World Cup after suffering a 2-1 defeat by Spain in their quarterfinal clash which took place on Thursday at the Stade Guy Piriou in Concarneau, France.
First-half goals from Spain's Aitana Bonmati and Patri Guijarro were enough to send the Falconets crashing despite Peace Efih's goal in the second half. Share this
