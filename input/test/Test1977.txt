JONESBORO, AR (KAIT) - The members of the parking authority at an area university want to help students avoid tickets.
Director of Parking Services at Arkansas State University Dave McKinney said the first few weeks of school can be hectic when it comes to traffic and parking.
McKinney said that's why they decided to give ASU students some options to make things easier.
"We now have an app we offer called Park Mobile," McKinney said. "Students can use this to pay for parking in the parking garage and even at a parking meter. You no longer have to have coins to plug the meter. You don't have to have cash or even your credit card. Just set up your account with Park Mobile and use your phone to pay to park."
You set up the account with your phone, using your license plate for identification.
McKinney said they also encourage students to remember three vital things.
"Get here early to give yourself plenty of time to find a parking space," McKinney said. "Make sure you have your parking permit with you. And also, make sure you understand the campus parking regulations."
McKinney said parking permits are required even on the first day of class.
He said everything is available now online.
You can print a permit off to put on your dashboard while you're waiting for the regular permit to arrive in the mail.
You can also get your parking permit at the ASU Parking office located at 2301 East Johnson Avenue.
