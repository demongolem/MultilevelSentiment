We write so much about the ones that never came home from the two world wars.
And those that did survive always say the real heroes were the ones who made the ultimate sacrifice.
But the truth is, without the millions who were saw it through to the end, there would have been no final victory.
They were all heroes, so many of them unsung and now forgotten. Men like Lieutenant John Henry Coleman, who served with the Royal Naval Volunteer Reserve â€¦ but whose bravery was displayed in the Nazi-occupied French countryside as a member of the resistance movement known as the Maquis. A French Resistance member at work on sabotaging train tracks.
Coleman was born in 1908 in Paris, the son of a Chilwell man who became managing director of the Franco-American Bank based in the French capital.
After early schooling in Lausanne, Coleman came to England and was a pupil at Nottingham High School from 1920-1923, living with a cousin in Beeston.
He returned to France but he and his father had to flee Paris when it was captured by the Nazis in 1940. Young Coleman was able to return to England, but his ailing father, then aged 80, was unable to get away. He was interned by the Germans but then released due to ill health, dying in Paris in 1943.

A report in the Nottingham Guardian, dated September 8 1945, details what happened next.
Coleman joined the Royal Navy and in 1942 was part of the ill-fated Dieppe raid, which aimed to test the German defences against a sea-borne invasion of mainland France. It was a disaster for the Allied forces. Of more than 6,000 multi-national troops including British, Canadian, American and French personnel who landed at Dieppe, 3,260 were either killed, wounded or captured. How the Nottingham Guardian told the story of Beeston war hero John Henry Coleman.
After that debacle, Coleman decided to use his intimate knowledge of France by volunteering for service with the French Resistance Movement.
It was the job of the resistance, often advised by British and American secret agents, to disrupt German transport and supply lines, especially in the weeks leading up to the D-Day landings in June 1944.

According to the Nottingham Guardian, Coleman helped to sabotage railways and bridges, liaising with London through coded reports sent over radio sets which were never used twice in the same house for fear of being tracked by the Germans, whose reprisals against resistance members, and retaliation against innocent civilians, was ruthless and brutal.
It is estimated that 8,000 resistance members, men and women, were killed in action, 25,000 executed by firing squad and tens of thousands deported, of whom 27,000 died in death camps.
Coleman was based in the French city of Lyon, a major centre of resistance operations and which, today, provides a visitor trail of memorials and important sites linked to underground activities in the Second World War. The museum dedicated to the French Resistance in the city of Lyon.
"Lieut Coleman became the fearless deputy-leader of the Maquis in Lyons," reported the Guardian. "His chief was captured a few weeks before D-Day and Coleman took command until the chief escaped after the invasion.
"On one occasion, Lt Coleman 'studied' a railway while bathing in the river below. That night the bridge was blown up by the Maquis and that he (Coleman) regarded as his most satisfactory job."
In 1945 John Henry Coleman was presented with the MBE by King George VI.
An exhaustive search of official records has failed to find any further information about this forgotten hero of the Second World War.
