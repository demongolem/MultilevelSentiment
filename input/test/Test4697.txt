Mali: Incumbent Keita Declared Victor After Disputed Vote By Eromosele Abiodun In a move described as the reference point for digital marketing knowledge, influence and impact in Nigeria, the Lagos Digital Academy (LDA) has been officially inaugurated in Lagos. Co-Founder and Chief Marketing Officer of LDA, Kunle Shittu, in a statement, said the LDA is designed to create a step-change and equip digital migrants with market-driven, dynamic and practical trainings that would prepare them for quality placement and industry exposure. Shitu described the academy as an informatics leadership course for LDA digital migrants and leaders. According to him, "We breed a nest of digital potentials for companies to employ and empower to contribute to organisational growth." On his part, the Managing Director of LDA, Dotun Babatunde, explained that the birth of the company was as a result for professional and savvy digital professional who has gone through the burn of digital training or academy in the country. "The marketing communication industry in Nigeria is getting cluster but more importantly is that there is a huge skill gap when it comes to digital marketing. So giving the decades of experience of the LDA team, we came up with a way to equip the future generations and executives who have been in tuned to the traditional advertising and marketing platforms but do not understand how best to plug in digital to the equation as digital is part of every form of communications. This way out is LDA," he said. Dotun described the establishment of the academy as the "beginning of a profession." Shedding light on the programmes and courses of the academy, Co-Founder and Chief Strategy Office of LDA, Tola Bademosi said: "The programmes and courses of the academy will be designed and tailored along different clientele, because the needs are different based on wants, professions and backgrounds. The programmes are going to be empowering because knowledge without application is useless. Knowledge acquired must be applied so as to move from the current level to a higher one." Speaking at the launch, Chief Executive of CMC Connect, Yomi Badejo-Okusanya said: "I believe LDA is an initiative whose time has come and I have personally tasted the ability of LDA and I will recommend it very highly. Nigeria is increasingly emerging as a key player in the development of next-generation technology ecosystems and LDA is surely the destination for skill development mission from a digital perspective."
