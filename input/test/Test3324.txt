âˆ’ ''See also'' '''[[Health libraries]]''' | '''[[Media theory applied to information age]]''' | '''[[Top Social Media Sites in Medicine]]''' | '''[[Utopia Documents]]''' âˆ’ '''Cool tools for busy health librarians''' was a proposal for a continuing education (CE) workshop for the [http://www.chla-absc.ca/2009/ CHLA/ABSC Conference] in Winnipeg, Manitoba. Unfortunately, due to a lack of interest, the workshop was never delivered. During the planning of the workshop, this entry was used as the instructors' space for planning and exploration. Health librarians track new advances in medical evidence, particularly research that has an immediate impact on the provision of clinical care or in the delivery of library and information services. In the digital age, finding the evidence in a timely way may seem impossible due to the constant deluge of information. âˆ’ There may be help ahead with this continuing education course on ''cool tools''. In a highly-interactive and casual 'hands-on' environment, two working health librarian bloggers will lead you through a range of information technologies that can be used to enrich the web experience or deliver information ''at-point-of-care''. Through demonstration and discussion, we explore some of today's most useful Internet tools that can be used to manage and organize the information you (or your users) need to stay current. A digital sandbox will be provided after the workshop to help participants learn more about ''Cool tools'' into the future
