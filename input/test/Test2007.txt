Postgraduate law at ANU is truly accessible for professionals seeking to deepen their expertise, even those that don't live in Canberra.
"My master's degree benefited my career in many ways and was the launching pad for my career in global health law, " says Alexandra Phelan, who is now an Adjunct Professor at Georgetown University Law Centre in Washington DC and in the final semester of her Doctorate degree.
While studying a Master of Laws (LLM) and specialising in International law, Alexandra worked full-time as a solicitor at King & Wood Mallesons in Melbourne, and then overseas.
"I was able to take courses such as international climate law, humanitarian law, and human rights litigation which directly helped my work at King & Wood Mallesons, where I worked in M&A on climate and energy matters, as well as undertaking a range of pro bono work."
Alexandra was drawn to study at ANU because of its expertise in international law, global reputation, and the program's flexibility.
"Postgraduate law at ANU is truly accessible for professionals seeking to deepen their expertise, even those that don't live in Canberra.
"Despite not living in Canberra during my studies, I very much feel a part of the ANU Law community."
Having participated in the course "International Organisations", held in Geneva, Alexandra and other students met experts at the United Nations and other international organisations, which resulted in two internships: one at the World Health Organization's Gender, Equity, and Human Rights team, and the other in the legal team at the Gavi Alliance.
These internships allowed the LLM alumna to gain experience working directly in international law, human rights, and global health, and ultimately, to her decision to concentrate her career in global health law.
Alexandra will be completing her Doctorate at Georgetown University Law Centre in Washington DC which she undertook having received the General Sir John Monash Scholarship.
Her research focuses on the role of international law in preventing and responding to infectious disease epidemics, including pandemic influenza and recent outbreaks of Ebola and Zika.
