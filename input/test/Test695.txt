Apple reassures customers after reported hack by Australian teen Updated 32 sec ago Follow @arabnews
SYDNEY/SAN FRANCISCO: Apple said on Friday no customer data was compromised after Australian media reported a teenager had pleaded guilty to hacking into its main computer network, downloading internal files and accessing customer accounts. The boy, 16, from the southern city of Melbourne, broke into the US computer giant's mainframe from his suburban home many times over a year, The Age newspaper reported, citing statements by the teenager's lawyer in court. The teen downloaded 90 gigabytes of secure files and accessed customer accounts without exposing his identity, the paper said. Apple contacted the US Federal Bureau of Investigation when it became aware of the intrusion, The Age said, quoting statements made in court. The FBI then referred the matter to the Australian Federal Police (AFP). The report said an AFP raid on the boy's family home produced two laptops, a mobile phone and a hard drive that matched the intrusion reported by Apple. The sensitive documents were saved in a folder called "hacky hack hack," the report said. It said the boy had boasted about his activities on the mobile messaging service WhatsApp. An Apple spokesman said the company's information security personnel "discovered the unauthorized access, contained it, and reported the incident to law enforcement" without commenting further on the specifics of the case. "We ... want to assure our customers that at no point during this incident was their personal data compromised," the spokesman said. The AFP declined to comment because the matter was before the court. A court spokeswoman also declined to comment other than to say the teenager would be sentenced on Sept. 20. The boy's name could not be made public because he was a juvenile offender.

DUBAI: Dubai regulators have moved against Abraaj Capital, the UAE arm of the beleaguered private equity group, implementing a winding up order against it and stopping it doing any new business in the emirate's financial center. The Dubai Financial Services Authority, the regulatory arm of the Dubai International Financial Center (DIFC), announced the moves after the DIFC Courts earlier this month received a petition to wind up the troubled firm under UAE insolvency laws. The court has appointed two liquidators from the accounting firm Deloitte to oversee the winding up order. "The DFSA will continue to take all necessary actions within its remit to protect the interests of investors and the DIFC," the regulator said in a statement.
The DFSA also said it has stopped Abraaj Capital from moving funds to other parts of the group.
The DFSA has been monitoring events at the company since the scandal at Abraaj broke in February, involving redirection of investment funds to purposes for which they were not intended. Only a relatively small part of Abraaj's operations fall under the remit of the DFSA. Most of its business and assets are located in the Cayman Islands, the domicile for its ultimate holding company Abraaj Holdings Limited (AHL) and its main operation business Abraaj Investment Management. The Cayman entities are also going through liquidation procedures. The DFSA said: "Given the onset of financial difficulties of the wider Abraaj Group, the DFSA has been closely monitoring the activities of its regulated entity ACL. The DFSA has taken regulatory actions over the past few months in order to safeguard the interests of investors and the DIFC. "Given such actions and the current matters surrounding the Abraaj Group, the DFSA continues to monitor the limited financial services activities currently being undertaken by ACL," it added. ACL was authorized to conduct various financial services from DIFC, including managing assets and fund administration, but restricted to funds established by the firm or members of its group. It could also advise on financial products, arranging deals in investments, and arranging and advising on credit. It is unprecedented for the DFSA to comment on a case while it is still under investigation, but the application in the DIFC Courts on Aug. 1 presented an opportunity to address investors and DIFC members who were concerned about the scandal, which some observers believe has been damaging for Dubai's reputation as a regional financial hub.
