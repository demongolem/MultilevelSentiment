STFM blog, May 23, 2016.] âˆ’ * According to Wikipedia, '''[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeffrey_Beall Jeffrey Beall]''' is a librarian and associate professor at the University of Colorado, Denver, known for his monitoring and criticism of predatory open access publishing. He makes no claims about the titles he lists; the Beall list is a useful starting point for debate but each title should be evaluated and investigated. If scholars publish in the wrong journal this will be detected by their peers on tenure and promotion committees. Every field has a range of journals and reaching the widest possible audience sometimes means that papers are submitted to journals at the top tier. Beall's titles fall into some of the grey areas around top tier-not top tier. Librarians can provide information about suitable/unsuitable places to publish and explain why we think they are; it is up to scholars and researchers to decide what to do with the information. âˆ’ * The ''Nurse, Author, & Editor'' journal has put together some guidelines for editors to determine if a journal is predatory or not. These guidelines came out of the INANE (International Academy of Nursing Editors) annual meeting this August. Jeffrey Beall was one of the keynote speakers and spoke on the dangers of predatory publishing. While intended for editors, the list can definitely used by authors, including non-nursing authors, too.
