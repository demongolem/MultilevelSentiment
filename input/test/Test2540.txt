Home2 Suites by Hilton continues to be an industry-leader in the use of innovative building techniques announcing that the brand will open its first hotel using modular construction in early 2019. Developed by Southern Hospitality Services, LLC., and constructed by Akshar Development Inc., brand executives gathered yesterday at the future site of the Home2 Suites by Hilton San Francisco Airport North for a staging ceremony where pre-fabricated elements of the hotel were put into position. The hotel represents the Bay Area's first modular build hotel, and the first Home2 Suites by Hilton modular build.
Global Head of Home2 Suites by Hilton, Adrian Kurre, joined Mayor for the City of South San Francisco, Liza Normandy, and owners Roy Patel, Vijay Patel, and Bj Patel from Southern Hospitality Services to watch as a crane lifted and positioned the hotel's exterior panel pieces. Guests were also able to tour one of the pre-fabricated suites, featuring the brand's signature in-room kitchen and separate living and sleeping areas.
"Staying at the forefront of building trends has translated to faster construction and ramp-up times, making Home2 Suites one of Hilton's fastest-growing brands," said Adrian Kurre, global head, Home2 Suites by Hilton. "The unmatched efficiency of modular building allows us to provide a consistent, high-quality product constructed in as little as half the time of a traditional build, allowing owners to see an even faster return on their investment."
Modular construction is a process in which a project is built off-site in a controlled environment to produce "modules" which are then assembled on-location. This building technique allows for faster construction time without sacrificing quality, especially in high-barrier-to-entry markets where available skilled labor is limited. By using this process, construction time for the Home2 Suites by Hilton San Francisco Airport North property was cut nearly in half and will be significantly shorter than the average for the Bay Area market.
In addition, the property will incorporate several sustainability measures above the standards of the eco-friendly Home2 Suites by Hilton brand. Solar panels will produce close to 50 percent of the hotel's energy, a bio-retention pond will filter water run-off, and additional measures will help to reduce the hotel's overall carbon footprint.
Upon opening, Home2 Suites by Hilton San Francisco Airport North will offer all-suite accommodations with fully-equipped kitchens and modular furniture, providing guests the flexibility to customize their suite to their style and preference. The hotel will offer complimentary Internet, inviting communal spaces, and trademark Home2 Suites amenities such as Spin2 Cycle, a combined laundry and fitness area, Home2 MKT for grab-and-go items, and the Inspired Table; a complimentary daily breakfast that includes more than 400 potential combinations. Guests will enjoy a jacuzzi, outdoor fire pit and grill area and a game room.
The hotel will be part of Hilton HonorsÂ®, the award-winning guest-loyalty program for Hilton's 14 distinct hotel brands.
