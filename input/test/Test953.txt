DUBLIN- The "MVNO Business Plan 2018" report has been added to ResearchAndMarkets.com's offering.
Mobile Virtual Network Operator (MVNO) companies are launched for many different reasons, many of which have more to do with other businesses than the MVNO operation itself.
It is important to consider the strategies an MVNO will employ to exploit market opportunities.
Some questions to consider include:
Will the MVNO be a sub-brand to an existing business? Will the MVNO align with retail strategies of some other business? Will the MVNO offer discounted services compared to existing Mobile Network Operators (MNO)? Will the MVNO offer Machine-to-Machine (M2M) communications related services on a B2B basis rather than consumer services? Will the MVNO acquire data-only from the underlying MNO, relying upon messaging and voice over IP and delivered in an OTT model? Regardless of the overall MVNO strategy, executing upon a vision requires careful planning. One thing that all successful MVNOs have in common is they started with a well-developed business plan.
The MVNO Business Plan
This is a full business plan based on the launch of an illustrative MVNO known as Contendus. The plan covers all aspects of the company launch plan including market assessment, funding requirements, financial analysis, market segmentation and product differentiation. Also included is go-to-market plan, distribution and replenishment plans, comparison of MVNO's and more. The major benefit of this report is to assist in the development of an MVNO launch and to help validate existing plans.
Launching a MVNO involves a lot of careful planning and an understanding of the competitive threats and opportunities. Understanding the competitive issues and what type of MVNO to launch is key to success. A critical aspect to the success of any MVNO is its wholesale negotiations with the host mobile network operator (MNO). Accordingly, the MVNO Business Plan includes Modelling and Negotiation Strategies for Contracting with Host Mobile Network Operators. This includes rate structures of the retail minus and cost plus models, the pros and cons of each, and how to implement them.
The MVNO Business Plan also includes evaluation of wholesale incentives, the reconciliation process and also what macro and micro environmental aspects to consider when defining your negotiation strategy. Also includes is an example Service Level Agreement (SLA), modeled from real life operational MVNO SLAs, which can be customized and built upon to meet the needs of their service management requirements.
