The Home Office have launched a recruitment campaign in search for a head of the new countering extremism commission.
This new counter-extremism commission's aim is to facilitate training for schools and colleges on how to spot signs of radicalisation.
"And because there is a strong correlation between extremism and the poor treatment of women and girls, the commission will have a specific responsibility to ensure women's rights are upheld," the Home Office has acknowledged.
As the Quote: above reveals, the new commission also aims to uphold women's rights.
The formation of the new "Commission for Countering Extremism" was confirmed earlier this year in the Queen's Speech.
As the UK Government launched a recruitment campaign into motion with the aim of appointing a head for this commission â€“ new details of the body's objectives have been unveiled.
It will be in charge of not only providing examples; but also advising the government on new policies and laws, as well as helping communities and the public sector to combat extremism and promote fundamental British values.
"The commission will also help to train schools and colleges to spot the warning signs and stamp out extremism, as they have with racism," the Home Office stated.
The successful candidate for lead commissioner is expected to provide guidance to the home secretary regarding the commission's future role and contribute to shaping its priorities.
Home Secretary Amber Rudd said: "This government is committed to tackling extremism in all its forms â€“ as the prime minister said after the London Bridge attack earlier this year, enough is enough.
"The new Commission for Countering Extremism will have a key role to play in this fight. It will identify and challenge tolerance of extremism, tackle extremist ideology and promote British values, learning the lessons from the struggle against racism in the 20th century.
"The lead commissioner will head up this vital work and I look forward to working with the successful candidate."
The Department for Education (DfE) research report carried last month concluded that schools were being hyperactive in bringing up worries about radicalisation to social workers.
Putting the Prevent duty into action means the teaching staff must pay attention to concerning behaviour, identify children at risk of being radicalised, and refer those in need to social workers.
According to Tes poll, last year two-fifths of teachers complained they had just an hour of Prevent training . Among these, no less than 53 per cent expressed that they worry that this one-hour-training was not enough.
As you're hereâ€¦
5Pillars have one humble request from youâ€¦
Thousands of Muslims around the world visit our website for news every day. Due to the unfortunate reality of covering Muslim-related news in a heightened Islamophobic environment, our advertising and fundraising revenues have decreased significantly.
5Pillars is editorially and financially independent, with no sectarian or political allegiance to any particular group or movement. Our journalism has been exclusively grassroots focussed and our sole purpose is to defend Islam and Muslims in the media.
This makes us unique in comparison to other online Muslim media outlets who are neither independently regulated by a reputable body nor are they managed by qualified journalists.
Our journalism takes time, money and effort to deliver. But we do it because we believe we have a duty to Allah (swt).
You may not agree or like everything we publish. However, which other Muslim news site that is run by experienced journalists will take on the responsibility of being a shield for Islam and Muslims in the media?
If you follow 5Pillars, and you understand its importance in today's climate, then please support us for as little as Â£5 a month, it only takes a minute to make a donation. Jazakallah khayran.
