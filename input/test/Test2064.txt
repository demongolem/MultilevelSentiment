The crowdfunded Anesi bra is the first to shrink or expand as your cup size changes Chloe Street Reblog Bra shopping. Two little words that have filled many a woman with dread. Finding the right fit and style at an affordable price is a minefield. And given the average UK bra size is now a 36DD, and yet most high street lingerie brands only cater up to a DD cup, the task is, for half of the women in Britain, even trickier. Advances in fashion and technology mean we have invented smart chip-embedded designer garms and quick dry fabrics, so why is the design and performance of most bras still so comparatively crude? Enter Canadian start-up House of Anesi, who are on a mission to address the status quo with a revolutionary new high-tech bra they've designed to be able adapt to a woman's breast size changes. (House of Anesi) More Brand founders Stephania Stefanakou, Jacob John and Leen Al-Taher met at the University of Ryerson in Toronto, where they were studying fashion design, aerospace engineering and industrial engineering respectively. Applying their unique combination of skillsets to the task of bra design, they entered (and won) a university competition with a design for a bra which claims to do away with back pain, red raw strap-marked shoulders, boob sweat and underwire marks. Now they're bringing the product to market via a Kickstarter campaign, which has already raised Â£28,511 of its Â£38,806 goal, with 20 days left to go. (House of Anesi) More Using engineering and tech, the trio have tackled issues such as 'spilling out,' wardrobe 'malfunctions,' and hormonal tenderness, and claim to have created a bra that 'actually takes care of the female body, and treats breasts, not as objects to push up, minimize, and contort, but with the respect that they deserve.' The bra underwiring is metal-free, and the cup is made of a flexible nylon that stays snug during body changes and conforms to the natural shape of your breasts. It can shift up to two cup and band sizes, promising not to stretch if your breasts shrink. So whether your breasts are asymmetric, growing or shrinking, you're pregnant or you're due your period, the bra will fit perfectly. The Anesi bra (Anesi means comfort in Greek), is also constructed using cooling gel straps that mould to your shoulders' natural contour and distribute weight evenly, reducing back pain. Plus, unlike the foam typically used in bras, the Anesi has moisture-wicking and antimicrobial properties, keeping sweat stains (and smells) at bay. Story Continues (House of Anesi) More Their mission to construct the perfect bra saw the brand founders test 80 underwire prototypes and over 30 gels, and has seen 20 complete bra design iterations through the hands of three manufacturers, before settling on the perfect design. Not only is the bra's technology the first of its kind, it's also the most size-inclusive and is going to be available in over 90 sizes in both a full coverage and balconette style (it's currently available in 40). The bras are available for an earlybird price of Â£51 (plus international shipping costs), which is 35 per cent off the eventual retail price. The brand has plans to expand into matching, equally supportive knickers and a whole range of colours, including a full range of 6-8 nude skin tones.
