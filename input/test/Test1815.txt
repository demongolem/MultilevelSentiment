Method for Manufacturing of a Rotor<br />Abstract:<br />(EN)<br />A method for manufacturing a rotor includes the following operations: the clamping of a workpiece in a grinding machine; the performance of one or more cylindrical grinding operations whereby a rotor shaft section is ground to the desired diameter with a cylindrical grinding disk; the performance of one more profile grinding operations whereby a rotor body is profiled with a profile grinding disk. During the manufacture of the rotor in the grinding machine, the workpiece is not undamped and the cylindrical grinding operations and the profile grinding operations are done with the same grinding machine.<br /></form><br /
