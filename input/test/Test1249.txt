He said the move would save the county money. He said the polling places had disability compliance issues.<br />But many people in the county assumed a more sinister motive, especially with the state in the midst of a hotly contested election for governor. It pits a Democrat who would be Georgiaâ€™s first black chief executive against a white Republican who has been called a â€œmaster of voter suppressionâ€� by his political opponents.<br />â€œI think it was an effort to suppress the vote,â€� Bobby Jenkins, 66, a retired Randolph County school superintendent, said after a meeting on Wednesday where local residents complained that African-Americans in poor rural areas would be left having to drive long distances to vote. â€œThis is one typical strategy in the Republican playbooks.â€�<br />The Randolph County plan will almost certainly fizzle out on Friday morning in a vote by the countyâ€™s board of elections. But some say it may not be the last flash point over voting access in Georgia.<br />Mistrust and bad blood permeates what is shaping up to be a historic election for governor. In the years leading up to the showdown between Brian Kemp, the Republican secretary of state, and Stacey Abrams, the Democratic former state House minority leader, Georgia has been caught up in one controversy after another, locally and statewide, over election integrity, voting access and race.<br />The elections board has only two voting members right now, a white man and a black woman, and both would have to vote yes for the proposal to be adopted. Neither member could be reached for comment this week. But Tommy Coleman, the countyâ€™s attorney, said on Thursday that he had spoken with both of them. â€œI do not expect it to pass,â€� he said.<br />Mr. Coleman also sent a letter this week<br />terminating the countyâ€™s contract<br />with the consultant who recommended the polling-place closings, Mike Malone.<br />The American Civil Liberties Union has been sending its members to observe meetings of other local election commissions across the state, and to watch for similar proposals that could curtail voter access, according to Andrea Young, the executive director of the groupâ€™s Georgia chapter.<br />â€œWe sort of anticipated a bit of whatâ€™s happening in Randolph County, that there might be efforts to close polls ahead of this election,â€� Ms. Young said.<br />The two candidates, Mr. Kemp and Ms. Abrams, have squared off over voting rights before. As secretary of state, Mr. Kemp has overseen Georgiaâ€™s elections since 2010. He is a fervent fan of President Trump, who has made numerous<br />claims<br />about voter fraud.<br />For years, Mr. Kempâ€™s critics in Georgia, including Ms. Abrams, have accused him of supporting policies that adversely affect minority voters and contravene federal law. They also say he has conducted overzealous investigations of voter registration groups, including one founded by Ms. Abrams. The stateâ€™s Democratic Party has called on him to resign his current office in order to ensure an impartial election.<br />Mr. Kemp has insisted that he had nothing to do with the plan to close polling places in Randolph County, and wrote to the county advising it not to go ahead with the plan.<br />Unfettered access to the polls for minority voters is vital to Ms. Abramsâ€™s election campaign. She has adopted a strategy that relies less on wooing conservative white Democrats in the countryside, as her party has done in the past, and more on a surge of highly motivated liberals and nonwhite voters, in an increasingly diverse state: By 2030, non-Hispanic whites are expected to make up less than half the population.<br />For decades, the federal government acted as a referee on voting issues in the Deep South under the Voting Rights Act of 1965. But the Supreme Court sharply curtailed federal oversight in a 2013 decision.<br />Before that ruling, a polling-place consolidation proposal like the one that has rocked Randolph County would almost certainly have been subject to preclearance review by the Justice Department, with the county obliged to show that it would not disproportionately disadvantage minority voters.<br />Mr. Malone, an independent election consultant, had been hired by the county earlier this year to help it with voting logistics after the county elections superintendent resigned.<br />In community meetings last week, Mr. Malone said that the seven polling places were not heavily used â€” just 12 people voted at one of them in a recent election â€” and that some did not comply with the Americans With Disabilities Act.<br />But when the word got out about his proposal, it struck many as drastic. The civil liberties union wrote to the county that the plan would make it â€œdisproportionately harderâ€� for black voters to cast a ballot. The Lawyersâ€™ Committee for Civil Rights Under Law threatened to sue, arguing that closing the polling places over accessibility made little sense.<br />â€œForcing elderly, disabled, and other persons with mobility issues to travel lengthy distances to vote is out of place with the purported goal of A.D.A. compliance,â€� its lawyers wrote to the county.<br />Suspicion also spread that Mr. Kemp was somehow behind the recommendation â€” a claim he adamantly denies.<br />Image<br />Stacey Abrams, the Democratic candidate for governor of Georgia, is banking on a surge in voting by liberals and nonwhite Georgians in November.

Morton/Associated Press<br />A spokeswoman for the secretary of stateâ€™s office, Candice Broce, said that an official in her office had recommended Mr. Malone to the county as a qualified election expert, but that he was one of several consultants mentioned.<br />In public meetings, Mr. Malone has shown a slide saying that a policy of consolidating polling places â€œhas come highly recommended by the secretary of state.â€� But Ms. Broce said that Mr. Kempâ€™s office urged the county to abandon Mr. Maloneâ€™s plan.<br />â€œThey need to focus on preparing for a secure, accessible, and fair election in November,â€� she said. â€œOur position on this issue is crystal clear.â€�<br />Some black Georgia residents say they are primed to be skeptical of Republican motives, given the repeated efforts by Republican officials to limit voting access in the name of efficiency or fraud prevention.<br />Republican state lawmakers introduced a bill earlier this year to curtail early voting on Sundays, when many black Christian congregations conduct â€œSouls to the Pollsâ€� voting drives. The legislation died<br />after being opposed<br />by the Rev. Raphael Warnock, senior pastor at the Atlanta church where Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. once preached.<br />There have been local disputes in counties across the state over polling-place consolidation and other issues. But Mr. Kemp is the public official who has come in for the most criticism from Georgia liberals and voting-rights activists, who say he has been aggressive in trying to suppress minority voting.<br />In 2014, he was recorded encouraging a Republican group to register like-minded voters, and warning them that Democrats were â€œworking hardâ€� to register â€œall these minority voters that are out there and others that are sitting on the sidelines.â€�<br />Mr. Kempâ€™s supporters maintain that he is a champion of ballot access,<br /
