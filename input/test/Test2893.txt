ACT Brumbies captain Sam Carter knows winning grand finals is hard, but the real tough stuff will start when he returns home next week to his drought-hit family farm in northern NSW.
Carter will be aiming for back to back John I Dent Cup titles when Royals play Tuggeranong in the Canberra premier division grand final at Viking Park on Saturday.

But a trip to Scone earlier this week for a 'let's tackle the drought together' event with teammate Lachlan McCaffrey, and a planned visit to Quirindi next week have helped put rugby in perspective.
Carter's parents have a 6500-acre farm with cattle and crops, and like most of NSW they're crying out for some rain after almost 12 months of nothing.

"It's rained only about twice or three times at mum and dad's place, and even then it wasn't significant rain. We've got enough water for the cattle, but we've got to buy in some feed.
"Farmers are proud people and they count on resilience to get them through. Sometimes they don't want to show they're hurting, but if they are struggling people are their to help.
"And that's one of the best things about what we did on Monday was that they got out there and talked to each other. Anyway we can help is a plus."
Carter will be part of a distinct Brumbies flavour in the grand final , teaming up with Andy Muirhead and Lausii Taliauli, while Tuggeranong boasts Jordan Jackson-Hope, Ben Hyne, Darcy Swain and Len Ikitau.
"I love turning up every weekend and ripping in with the Royals boys," Carter said.
"It will be good to go against Darcy, he's a good kid on the up. He rips and tears, I don't think he'll be holding back but neither will I."
Royals are the defending champions are going through last season unbeaten, but Tuggeranong emerged as the title favourites after clinching the minor premiership this year.

Playmaker Thompson has to pass a fitness test to take his place in the starting side after struggling to overcome a hamstring injury, threatening what would be a perfect way to end his comeback season in Canberra.
Thompson left the capital last year to test himself in Japan, but the 31-year-old returned to the capital to find his love of rugby again.
"I felt like I had some unfinished business here," Thompson said. "Now we're in the big dance against a team that everyone wants to beat after how well they did last year.
Loading "It should be a bloody good game. I've been in and out with injuries this year, just some niggles as you get older. But I'm really enjoying it this year, especially with this group of boys."
Royals and Tuggeranong have shared the past seven titles, but Royals haven't won two grand finals in a row since 1990-91.
Captain Ben Johnston missed most of the season after having a shoulder reconstruction in December, but the inspirational leader always had his eyes on a Royals comeback to chase another premiership.
"It has been different this year, it's been a learning curve for how I carry myself when I'm injured," Johnston said.
"I said at the start of 2017 if I ever had a major operation, I'd finish [my career]. But the excitement of last year, it got me super keen and I didn't want to finish [with injury]. I didn't want to leave the club like that."
