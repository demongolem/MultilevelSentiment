new truck's<br />puzzle is the eTorque mild hybrid system, and that's what brings me to Lexington, Kentucky this week. From crowded streets through small towns to wide-open highway runs, the Bluegrass State is a perfect place to test out the Ram's new hybrid hardware.<br />Behind the scenes<br />Ram 1500's<br />on-road manners. Some regenerative braking systems are abrupt in engagement, making for jerky stops, and I've tested many a stop-start system with noticeable harshness during engine restart. But none of these are an issue in the Ram. Brake force is progressive, the regen helpful in recharging the 430 watt-hour lithium-ion battery pack, and the stop-start system works with the 48-volt belt-drive motor generator instead of a traditional starter, for quick, seamless power-on transitions.<br />On the expressways outside Lexington, cylinder deactivation is also mostly imperceptible when cruising at a steady 70 miles per hour. There's still a slight shudder when the Hemi V8 switches back and forth between eight- and four-cylinder modes, but active frame-mounted dampers absorb most vibrations and noise cancellation snuffs out the majority of the audible racket inside the cabin. Really, Ram's integration of the hybrid system is excellent and most people likely won't know it's working away behind the scenes.<br />The new Ram 1500 eTorque has arrived, offering more efficiency and performance.<br />Jon Wong/Roadshow<br />Ram<br />has you covered. The base 3.6-liter Pentastar V6 comes standard with eTorque, putting out 305 horsepower and 269 pound-feet of torque, and able to tow a respectable 7,750 pounds. A very brief drive in the V6 again impresses with the hybrid integration, mirroring the experience in the V8 with normal brake pedal behavior and brisk engine start-ups. On the road, the V6 eTorque behaves a lot like the V8, in that you don't really notice it all that much. There is a clear power difference between the two models, of course, but the V6 is by no means slow.<br />What's the primary goal of all the eTorque mild<br />hybrid<br />sorcery? Efficiency, of course. According to EPA estimates, the eTorque system is good for a 2-mpg improvement in the city cycle with the V8, for 17 mpg, compared to 15 mpg in the standard Hemi model. On the highway, the Hemi by itself returns 22 mpg with two-wheel drive and 21 mpg with four-wheel drive, but with eTorque increases those figures to 23 mpg and 22 mpg, respectively. Official fuel economy numbers aren't available just yet for the V6, but Ram engineers say the eTorque setup should result in a small bump over the<br />2018 Ram 1500<br /
