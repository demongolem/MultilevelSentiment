Hero.Loan, The New Way to VA TheHomeLoanExpert.com Working to Save Vets Time & Money ST. LOUIS, MO, November 16,   Veterans and military families will soon have a new, simpler path to getting a home loan. TheHomeLoanExpert.com , a premier mortgage lender known for their support of community and veterans' causes, has developed a new loan program that completely changes the VA experience. All of the detail can be found at Hero.Loan . Based on the VA Loan, the Home Loan Expert's new VA experience is designed to streamline the mortgage process for the men and women who've served this country. Through this new loan program, TheHomeLoanExpert.com team will be able to deliver the best mortgage product of its kind to their customers, along with an even more personalized loan experience. The Home Loan Expert, LLC founder, and President Ryan Kelley says his team spent a year-and-a-half creating Hero.Loan. "The VA Loan is already one of the best benefits offered to our military veterans and their families," Kelley said, but there was room for improvement. "Standard VA Loans can take upwards of 60-120 days to close, we close VA loans in as little as 14 days," he said. The Hero Loan is designed to be easier, smoother, and faster. Kelley says he's excited to launch the new loan program. "It was time for us to do something special for the men and women who have given so much to protect our freedoms," he said. TheHomeLoanExpert.com team has found ways to better customize the loan experience for their clients. TheHomeLoanExpert.com has received the highest delegation the VA can bestow on a lender. Ryan says that means they are trusted to handle every aspect of the loan. The delegation gives them "automatic authority" to process the loan from start to finish--all in-house--saving weeks of back-and-forth paperwork between offices. But that wasn't enough for Ryan and TheHomeLoanExpert.com team. Ryan says they wanted to do more. So, the Hero.Loan website comes with benefits galore. It starts with Ryan's team of "VA Specialists" who go out of their way to create a personalized loan experience for each of their customers. They make it a point to meet with their clients face to face. "They don't even have to come to our office for this," Ryan said. "We are happy to come to them at home, the office, on base or even their favorite Starbucks," he added. With Hero.Loan, the team expands on traditional VA Loans by working with their customers earlier in the loan process. As with most veterans and military benefits in the U.S., VA Loans have certain eligibility requirements. Because the loans are guaranteed by the Veterans Administration, loan applicants must apply for and receive a certificate of eligibility. Lenders typically require customers to get that certificate themselves before they can even start to work with them. At Hero.Loan, the Homer Loan Expert's VA Specialists walk their clients through that government application process and help them get their certificate of eligibility. TheHomeLoanExpert.com underwrites all their VA loans in-house. That allows for lower mortgage rates and much quicker turnaround times. It also means there are never any upfront or out of pocket costs for veterans, military personnel, and their families. That includes the appraisal. At Hero.Loan, Ryan Kelley pays all of the appraisal fees. Ryan and his team at TheHomeLoanExpert.com have a long history of giving back to the community, especially to veterans' causes. The company has done extensive fundraising through marathons, and other events. This year they partnered with 101 ESPN and created Climb for PTSD at Ballpark Village in downtown St. Louis before every Friday night Cardinals' home game. Ryan has himself completed the Bataan Memorial Death March twice, with plans to participate in 2018 as well. The annual 26.2-mile march over high desert terrain at White Sands Missile Range in New Mexico honors the heroic service members who sacrificed much to defend the Philippine Islands during World War II. Ryan says giving back to veterans has been a priority over his 15-years in the mortgage lending industry. With that in mind, Hero.Loan will partner with the Fisher House Foundation, which gives military and veterans' families a comfortable place to stay while their loved one is receiving medical treatment. Their Hero Miles program uses donated frequent flyer miles to bring family members to the bedside of injured service members. Their Hotels for Heroes program uses donated hotel points to allow family members to stay at hotels near medical centers free of charge. Since it began, Fisher House has served more than 300,000 military and veterans' families. The team at Hero.Loan will guide customers through the entire VA loan process from start to finish to ensure our American heroes have a great experience purchasing or refinancing their home. Ryan says launching Hero.Loan is especially exciting for him and his team. This new VA Experience, as well as other mortgage products from TheHomeLoanExpert.com are available in Missouri, Illinois, Indiana, Tennessee, and Alabama.
