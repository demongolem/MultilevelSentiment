Squatty Potty, LLC, of St. George, Utah is recalling approximately 2,400 of the "Squatty Pottymus" children's toilet step stools because the top can detach and children can fall from the toilet step stool.
Squatty Potty has received 2 reports of children falling off of the stool. One girl hit her chin on the toilet and bit the inside of her mouth, causing her to bleed. Another child fell and hit his head on a wall.
According to the recall notice posted by the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) on December 19, 2017:
The top removable step (hat) on the recalled children's toilet step stools can detach while a child is standing on it, posing injury and fall hazards."
The "Squatty Pottymus" step stool is designed to look like a gray hippopotamus with blue or purple eyes. It has a height-adjusting blue "hat" for a top step and cut-outs that function as handles on each side.
Consumers should stop using the "hat" part of the Squatty Pottymus step stool. Contact Squatty Potty for instructions on how to return the hat portion of the stool, free of cost, for a $10 refund.
They were sold online at squattypotty.com and Amazon.com between September 2017 and November 2017 for about $50.
